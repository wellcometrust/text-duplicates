PREFACE TO THE SIXTY-SEVENTH EDITION.

    </li>
    <li id=21 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Of all the diseases to which mankind is liable, there are few more dangerous, accompanied with more varied symptoms, or which attack a greater number of vital organs, whether simultaneously, or successively, than those resulting from the immoderate discharge of the seminal fluid.

    </li>
    <li id=22 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Difference of age, temperament, climate, season, profession, &amp;c, ceteris paribus, may induce different degrees of severity; but still they are all the same in kind, and require accordingly the same line of treatment, to be modified, of course, with respect to its activity, by individual circumstances.

    </li>
    <li id=23 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The commencement of these affections is, generally speaking, of a very insidious character, and frequently masked under the deceptive appearances of several other diseases: and what adds to the difficulty is, that the patient, so far from acknowledging the causes which have brought him to his wretched state more especially when such cause happens to be the hateful practice of masturbation, in general positively denies that he has ever indulged in such a practice, though he afterwards is forced to confess all.

    </li>
    <li id=24 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Should the unfortunate victim of self-pollution or excessive venery wilfully neglect his case, even after he has laid aside the debasing practice, he will linger, perhaps, for years, in a state of languor and debility; the joys of the marriage-bed and the delights of domestic happiness are for ever denied him; the love of offspring—the tenderest and most enchanting passion of the human heart—with him can never be gratified, his name and race will fade away and become extinct.

    </li>
    <li id=25 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Reduced by this execrable vice to the most abject state of human wretchedness— an object of commiseration to some who remember what he once was, in the full enjoyment of healthful vigor and manly promise, the fond idol of a mother&#39;s joy, the beloved staff of a father&#39;s hope in his declining age, now become a subject of ridicule to the heartless and unfeeling; pointed at by all as a beacon to caution others against the fatal rock on which his youthful hopes, and once brightened prospects, have been wrecked, is left to eke out a wretched and miserable existence, a prey to all the horrors of self-reproach, and a melancholy example of the vengeance of an angry God on those who, by abusing their bodies by the degrading habit of self-pollution, have, by the very worst and most sinful form of suicide, hurried themselves into a premature grave.

    </li>
    <li id=26 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To point out these dismal but certain effects of this unnatural and hideous vice—to send forth a warning voice to those addicted to its practice-to palliate, to relieve, and finally to remove such sad effects— to restore and re-establish the pristine health and vigor, when impaired by this foul habit—such were the views—such the objects I entertained in preparing the First edition of &quot;Manhood&quot; in 1840; such are the sentiments—such the feelings, which now influence me in sending forth this the SIXTY-SEVENTH EDITION after the lapse of twelve years.

    </li>
    <li id=27 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The sale of 20,000 Copies Of This Wobk in so short a time, a fact, in corroboration of which I beg leave to subjoin the declarations before the Lord Mayor, first of my printer, and secondly of my bookbinder, cannot but be deemed a convincing proof of the large share of public confidence which I have enjoyed, and which I still continue to enjoy—an amount of confidence, in fact, which never could have been attained, did I not produce something of more sterling value than the idle parade of vain promises and empty professions, impudently couched in language pilfered and plagiarised.

    </li>
    <li id=28 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      And here I feel called upon in justice to myself, as well as to the public, by way of Caution—to enter my decided and solemn protest against the daring effrontery and barefaced impudence of those ignorant pretenders to medical skill, who attempt to deceive the public by their announcements in the newspapers, professing to cure the same class of diseases to which I have devoted my exclusive energies for so long a period, and with such acknowledged and established success.

    </li>
    <li id=29 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The contemptible conduct as well as the total incapacity of these persons is sufficiently striking, when I solemnly assert, many pages of this work have been pirated by them.

    </li>
    <li id=30 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In preparing the present improved and enlarged edition of &quot;Manhood,&quot; I have taken due care amply to avail myself of the vast experience, which, considering the unprecedented share of public confidence with which I have been favoured, I must necessarily have attained in a class of diseases for which Pathology has as yet done so very little, that the only sure guide for





# their successful treatment must be an enlightened and well-trained experience, based on the only sure foundation—Extended Practice.

    </li>
    <li id=31 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From a vast number of new cases which have been successfully treated by me, I take the opportunity of inserting a few for the reader&#39;s perusal.

      The feelings which must excite the physician, while writing on the subject of Onanism, are pain and hope: pain, on account of the necessity for his advice and admonition; hope, that he may remove the delusion under which the infatuated victims of this vice labour: that the practice is a vice, a most pernicious vice, and which calls alike for the reprobation of the moralist as well as the physician, cannot be denied; it is an offence in the eye of our Creator.

      The subject of Impuissance, or Sexual Debility, as being of singular importance, and one in which the interests of society at large, and not merely of its unhappy victims, are so vitally concerned, has received consideration in a separate and distinct article.

    </li>
    <li id=50 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To this part of the subject I have paid the most anxious and untiring attention from a very early period of my professional career.

      It is one, in fact, in which not a day passes that I am not consulted, either by personal visit, or by correspondents in different parts of the kingdom, and I feel that I am not exceeding the limits of truth, nor transgressing the bounds of professional etiquette, in asserting that the mode of practice, suggested and improved by long and multiplied experience, has been productive of the happiest and most successful results in the treatment of sexual debility in both sexes.

      The manner in which I have endeavoured to connect the effects produced by masturbation on the physiological functions of the several organs of the body, will, I trust, be found sufficiently clear even for the nonmedical reader.

      The accounts given in books with respect to the ruinous effects of onanism, cannot but appear exaggerated, unless the necessary connexion between these effects and the habit itself be clearly demonstrated.

      It will not, I am sure, be deemed irrelevant, if I here present to the reader a statement of the motives which influenced me in thus devoting myself exclusively to this important branch of medical practice, having, from an early period of my professional life, determined on making the diseases of the male sexual system my exclusive line of practice.

    </li>
    <li id=77 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The advantages of a division of labour are nowhere more evident than in medicine.

    </li>
    <li id=78 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This determination I was induced to adopt, from observing the strange and unaccountable anomaly, namely, that the ordinary and general run of medical practitioners, who engage in the treatment of all manner of diseases indiscriminately, have obviously not paid that attention to diseases of the sexual system, and more especially to those affections which are the results of onanism, excessive venereal indulgence, and infection, which they have to other affections, which are not near so important either in a social, religious, or individual point of view.

    </li>
    <li id=79 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The consequence of this apathy on the part of the ordinary practitioner, has opened a wide field for the daring and ignorant, who usurping the ground thus left unoccupied by the educated surgeon through motives of mistaken professional delicacy, commit their daily and dreadful ravages on a too confiding public, who are proverbially known to place a confidence in such impudent pretenders, proportioned to the barefacedness of their claims, and their ignorance of disease.

    </li>
    <li id=80 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Impressed with the thorough conviction of the necessity of this neglected branch of medical science being attended to by men who have received a regular professional education, I have for my own part, since my entrance into the profession, devoted a considerable portion of my time and attention to investigate the nature and best mode of treatment of all those affections, connected, whether remotely or proximately, with early abuses of the generative organs; whether such abuse may consist in the unnatural practice of self-pollution, in excessive indulgence in venereal pleasures, or in the effects too often left behind by infectious diseases of these organs—effects occasioned either by neglect of the disease, or by its injudicious treatment.

    </li>
    <li id=81 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In order to be understood with respect to the affections remotely connected with early abuse, I need only refer to the daily, nay, hourly occurrence of the most anomalous cases in





Eersons of both sexes; some will complain of constant eadaches, pains in the limbs, debility and relaxation of the flexor and extensor muscles of&quot; the extremities, teazing cough; others, again, will complain of palpitations, weakness of stomach, and of all the digestive organs, from the comparatively trifling symptoms of indigestion to the more serious symptoms of total aversion to food.

    </li>
    <li id=82 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Let persons so affected be brought to an ordinary and general practitioner, but one who has not deemed it compatible with his professional dignity to devote any particular attention to the mischievous effects of sexual abuse; and if his patient should for instance complain of headache, he will probably, without further investigating the origin of the disease, take it for granted that such headache is the result of determination to the brain, and accordingly prescribe bleeding, purging, and other debilitating remedies.

    </li>
    <li id=83 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      What must the consequence be in such a case if the headache should arise, as we know it may, from exhaustion of the nervous centres occasioned by masturbation, or by excessive venery?

    </li>
    <li id=84 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

      A patient, already exhausted by one of the most effectual consumers of the vital energies, is subjected to a course of treatment the very reverse of that which his state requires.

      The little strength which the destructive habit may have left him, is sure to be taken from him by the doctor—I need say no more.

      Another patient comes to the mere routine practitioner with a long list of symptoms, such as tremors, partial paralysis, occasional flushing of face, dizziness of the head, cum multis aliis; the doctor, fancying that such symptoms clearly indicate approaching apoplexy, bleeds, blisters, vomits, and purges the very vitals out of the unfortunate patient, whose ailments, if carefully investigated, are in reality all attributable to self-pollution, and consequently require a diametrically opposite mode of treatment





How often do I not meet, in my every-day practice, cases such as the following: a young woman is brought to me, whose chief ailments are palpitations of the heart, short dry cough, occasional headache, great aversion to making exertion of any kind, great languor and lassitude, loss of appetite, or else perverted appetite, irregular, but in general deficient, menstruation, swelling of the ancles, puffiness of the face, with a chlorotic cast of countenance, tendency to hysterics, &amp;c.

    </li>
    <li id=88 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Full oft and many a time have I detected the real source and origin of such affections to be neither more nor less than the long-indulged habit of self-pollution.

    </li>
    <li id=89 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Numerous are the cases which my professional experience could supply of this kind.

    <li id=90 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      What I would impress upon the reader&#39;s mind is this; that a person not accustomed to observe and investigate such cases, cannot possess that tact, that incommunicable tact not to be acquired by the perusal of any other book, save the book of nature; it is this tact alone which will enable him to penetrate into the recondite and remote causes of these diseases; his eye, his touch, nay, every sense and faculty must be assiduously and carefully educated, in order that he may be able to detect the real seat and nature of the disease in question.

    </li>
    <li id=91 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I have, moreover, good reason to know that such a practitioner, when by his judicious mode of examining his patient he has gained his or her confidence, will be much more successful in eliciting an acknowledgment with respect to the habits which the person may have indulged in, and which may have been the real cause of the disease, than the man who will take it for granted that the feelings and ailments referred to the head, back, chest or abdomen, have their rise and origin in these cavities, and will not reflect that such ailments are but the symptoms or effects of the serious injury done to the nervous system by the destructive habit of self-abuse.

    </li>
    <li id=92 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Numerous are the occasions where I have succeeded, by a well-connected series of questions, in obtaining a candid acknowledgment from the blushing stripling of his having indulged in this vile habit.

    </li>
    <li id=93 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Some may say that I have overwrought the picture in this my description of the hideous consequences of onanism, because, forsooth, the rise of years, and the maturity of reason, frequently assist in subduing this propensity after the individual has indulged in it for a length of time.

    </li>
    <li id=94 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is, however, when old age begins to come on, and when the energies of the body are on the wane, that the effects of the indiscretions of youth will show themselves; &#39;tis then the autumn of life, and its precipitate and pitiable decay will be embittered by the recollection of former transgressions against the laws of nature and of nature&#39;s God, and by the harrowing and torturing consciousness of having misapplied and grossly abused those physical and moral endowments conferred by a beneficent and all-wise Creator for the purpose of propagating the species, and of contributing our mite to the extension and cultivation of that society to which we all belong, but against whose interests we may have so scandalously rebelled.

    </li>
    <li id=95 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The effects of the practice of self-abuse have been too frequently mistaken for other diseases.

    </li>
    <li id=96 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This arises partly from the want of sincerity and candour on the part of the patient, who, not acknowledging the true source of his distemper, deceives and misleads his medical adviser; partly, also, from the medical practitioner himself not being accustomed to meet cases of the kind, or not having devoted sufficient attention to their investigation, without which it is impossible to attain that discriminating tact which is so necessary to detect the cunning and artifice practised by patients in concealing the destructive source of so many complicated maladies; the medical practitioner himself, from the causes now alleged, too often overlooks, or is deceived as to the nature of the case submitted to his treatment.

    </li>
    <li id=97 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      What he sets down to be originally seated in the brain, spinal cord, lungs, heart, stomach, or intestinal canal, simulating idiopathic epilepsy, paralysis, phthisis, indigestion, diarrhoea, or obstinate constipation of the bowels, is, in reality, nothing else but the dismal effect of this ruinous practice.

    </li>
    <li id=98 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      With respect to impotence, or sexual debility, one of the most frequent as well as most distressing consequences of the baneful habit of self-abuse, I can safely and confidently assert, that my method of treatment, a method founded on an experience of many years, and on a close investigation of the nature and proximate causes of the disease, will be found to combine all the beneficial effects likely to result from a judicious application of medicinal means, to both mind and body.

    </li>
    <li id=99 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The employment of the so called aphrodisiac medicines in the removal of this disease is too frequently attended with the very worst effects.

    </li>
    <li id=100 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When it is known, that medicines to which aphrodisiac virtues are imputed are all powerful irritants, and that they exert their peculiar powers on the delicate mucous membranes of the genital and urinary organs, producing bloody urine, &amp;c, it will scarcely be necessary to point out even to the non-professional reader the dangers incurred in their use, and yet this is the class of medicines chiefly relied on by certain parties in the treatment of sexual debility.

    </li>
    <li id=101 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The practitioner who has duly studied the physiology of the generative functions, and the complex machinery involved in their discharge, knows full well the respective shares which both the mind and the body have in the due and effective performance of this function.

    </li>
    <li id=102 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He knows that in order that this act be performed well, two things are indispensably necessary; the body must be in good health, and the mind should be perfectly confident of the powers of the body.

    </li>
    <li id=103 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He should have no difficulties— no fear—no apprehension, not even an anxiety to perform the act well.

    </li>
    <li id=104 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      No function, in fact, of the entire machine is so dependent on the mind as this; the will and reasoning faculty have nothing whatever to do with this power, and yet there is no natural act in the adequate performance of which a man feels so deeply interested, his pride ever being more or less engaged in it.

    </li>
    <li id=105 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To those, therefore, who may have impaired their powers in discharging this function, either by selfabuse, excessive venereal indulgence, or any other circumstance, I hold out the most encouraging hopes of a speedy and effectual restoration to health and vigour, by the adoption of those physical and moral remedies, which I have been employing for so long a time with such signal success, and which I have never yet found to fail in a single instance, provided my directions were duly complied with.

      Varicocele.

    </li>
    <li id=384 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Varicocele is one of those diseases which the male sex is particularly liable to, in consequence of the length of the spermatic veins, the pendulous state of the testicles, the uncertain quantity of blood that is sent into them, and their unfitness to return it; and I think that Varicocele is as common in the male sex, as the disease of fluor-albus, or whites, is in the female, that probably one person in every three suffers from the complaint, more or less.

    </li>
    <li id=385 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is a disease which arises through a general relaxation of the arterial and venous system, which relaxation is produced by various causes, but more commonly arises from the unnatural act of Selfpollution.

    </li>
    <li id=386 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the preceding portion of my work, I have endeavoured to explain that the blood is conveyed from the aorta, or great artery, into the testicles, for the purpose of being secreted into seed, so as to be ready for use in the vesicula seminales, under the wise dispensation of Providence, which is given to man for the voluptuous enjoyment of venery, and for the reproduction of mankind; the testicles are also provided with veins to carry away the blood after the seed has been secreted in the testicle, and returns through the vena cava, or great vein, to be purified by the lungs; it then returns back into the aorta again to perform its functional duties.

    </li>
    <li id=387 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Now it is evident that if unnatural means are used to produce the voluptuous enjoyment of venereal pleasure, the vessels become acted upon immoderately, the system is drained of its sap, or vital juice, which is difficult to replenish, so that, during the act of Selfpollution, or upon any unnatural excitement of the genitals, more blood is brought into the testicle than it has strength to secrete into seed; therefore the blood cannot pass through, and congestion takes place, inflammation follows, and mortification is the sequel: but the more common result of these acts of unnatural gratification is, that the veins in the testicles swell, and, by pressing continually upon the gland of the testicle, cause it to give way and dwindle, the muscular fibres of the testicle and scrotum relax, drop down, and hang devoid of any muscular power whatever, and when felt by the fingers appear like a bag of earthworms, exactly as shewn in the engraving, Plate 6.

    </li>
    <li id=388 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

      A portion of the scrotum has been cut away to exhibit the healthy testicle of the right side, and the diseased testicle of the left side, which demonstrates the effects Self-pollution has had upon the genital organs, and also shows how requisite it is for medical aid to be obtained so soon as the patient finds the symptoms appear.

      An incrustation again appears on the wart, which remains until accident or the progress of ulceration removes it, and then the surface appears highly vascular, and discharges a bloody serum.

      Strictures of the Urethra.

    </li>
    <li id=432 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There are three kinds of Stricture, which are thus denominated,— the Permanent, Spasmodic, and Inflammatory.

    </li>
    <li id=433 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The Permanent Stricture is the result of a thickening of the urethra from chronic inflammation.

    </li>
    <li id=434 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The Spasmodic Stricture arises either from a contraction of the muscles surrounding the urethra, or from the urethra itself.

    </li>
    <li id=435 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The Inflammatory Stricture is produced through inflammation of the acute kind, which generally succeeds the acute Gonorrhoea.

    </li>
    <li id=436 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      At the commencement of the formation of every permanent Stricture there is a retention of a few drops of urine in the urethra,

B





after the whole appears to have been discharged; so that, when the penis has been returned into the small-clothes, the linen becomes slightly wetted, and if you press on the under side of the urethra a few more drops will be voided.

    </li>
    <li id=437 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The next circumstance is an irritable state of the bladder; which is evinced by the person not being enabled to sleep so long as usual without discharging his urine.

    </li>
    <li id=438 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A man in good health will not be obliged to empty his bladder for eight or nine hours, and some can go for a longer time, but when he has a stricture, he cannot continue for a longer period than three or four hours, and frequently much less than this time.

    </li>
    <li id=439 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The next circumstance in Stricture (and which is always a true prognostic of the existence of stricture) is the division of the stream; sometimes the stream splits in two, becoming forked; sometimes it is spiral; at other times it forms as it were a thin sheath.

    </li>
    <li id=440 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In addition, there will be a discharge from the urethra, which renders the linen of a bluish white, similar to the appearances produced by nocturnal emissions; if the patient rides much on horseback, the urine will be high-coloured, which is dependent upon the degree of excitement existing in the urethra.

    </li>
    <li id=441 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The next circumstance the patient notices is, that he discharges his urine by drops; and, through the irritable state of the bladder, the water is continually dropping from the orifice of the urethra.

    </li>
    <li id=442 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The next circumstance observable is the discharge of a considerable quantity of mucus along with the urine; the urine when discharged is as transparent as usual, but when it has cooled, the mucus descends to the bottom, where it appears ropy, and adheres to the vessel.

    </li>
    <li id=443 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      As the inflammation of the membrane increases, the urine becomes yellow, but when allowed to cool the mucus sinks, to the bottom.

    </li>
    <li id=444 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When the disease is of a very aggravated nature, the urine will become quite white.

    </li>
    <li id=445 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When the urine is bloody, it is a proof that ulceration has commenced.

    </li>
    <li id=446 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Those parts of the urethra which are more commonly liable to be strictured, are these :— First, that portion anterior to the bulb, just where it joins the corpus spongiosum—this part is naturally contracted and small, as shewn in Plate 16, Fig. 1; there is also another part liable to stricture, which is near the glans penis.

    </li>
    <li id=447 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The next situation in which we find stricture is in the membranous portion of the urethra, or that part between the bulb and prostate gland (as shewn in Plate 16, Fig. 1).

    </li>
    <li id=448 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The next situation is in the prostate gland itself (as shewn in Plate 16, Fig. 4).

    </li>
    <li id=449 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In some cases of Stricture, we find an accumulation of adhesive matter in the upper portion of the urethra (as shewn in Plate 16, P ig.

      The last figure of Stricture (as shewn in Plate 16, Fig. 5) represents the urethra torn by a patient having improperly introduced a bougie, being driven to madness through not being able to pass his urine; this person forced a bougie, as he thought, through the Stricture, instead of which he had lacerated the urethra and a portion of the corpora cavernosa; inflammation followed, and death terminated his sufferings; whereas, by skilfully introducing a propal-sized bougie, his life might have been preserved.

      The term Masturbation, from manus—the hand, and stupro—I defile, is the term more usually employed to express the idea intended to be conveyed in Holy Writ by the term Onanism, or the sin of Onan.

    </li>
    <li id=454 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      As the term Onanism, however, more strikingly expresses both the disgusting and destructive habit itself, as well as the punishment entailed on it, I have preferred it as the heading for this article.

    </li>
    <li id=455 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There are, I am well aware, many persons who, from an overstrained and overweening sense of modesty, object to the publication of books such as the present.

    </li>
    <li id=456 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They think that the perusal of such works has a tendency to suggest the abominable practice of which it treats, and whose dreadful effects it seeks to prevent and remedy, to persons of both sexes, who would otherwise never have dreamed of it.

    </li>
    <li id=457 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I freely admit that this objection would not be devoid of weight, were the practice less extended and less indulged in; unfortunately, I have good reason to know, from the position in which I am placed as a medical practitioner, that the habit is so well understood, and so generally indulged in, that it requires not the aid of reading for its dissemination; nor is theory at all in danger of rendering that more general, or more alluring, which is now unfortunately so firmly established and so- deeply rooted in our manners by the almost overwhelming force of practice.

    </li>
    <li id=458 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Nay, more, I have no hesitation in saying, that there is every reason to believe that there cannot be a more effectual means adopted for preventing an indulgence in the habit of self-pollution, than by pointing out to persons of both sexes the frightful consequences, both to body and mind, which inevitably follow from it.

    </li>
    <li id=459 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The necessity of defining the meaning of the terms Onanism, Masturbation, or Self-pollution, it will be readily admitted, does not exist.

    </li>
    <li id=460 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I shall therefore restrict myself to pointing out the causes which lead young persons to indulge in the filthy habit, to detailing the direful results which follow from such indulgence, and also the best means—both hygemic and medicinal, either for preventing young persons from addicting themselves to the practice, or for remedying the numerous and frightful diseases which it invariably brings with it.

    </li>
    <li id=461 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is an opinion entertained by many eminent and distinguished medical practitioners, an opinion, also, which seems to be supported by numerous and wellattested facts, that the diseases occasioned by indulgence in self-pollution become more frequent in proportion as society becomes more polished and more refined.

    </li>
    <li id=462 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Such a mischievous result cannot, however, for a moment be connected necessarily or naturally with the increasing improvements in the social state; it is produced.

    </li>
    <li id=463 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      only in a secondary manner,—and I feel convinced that it would be very possible, by removing the circumstances which favour and increase the corruption of public morals, if not to abolish altogether the ruinous habit of self-pollution, at least to diminish considerably the number of its miserable victims.

    </li>
    <li id=464 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      As one of the most effectual means of bringing about this desirable result, I take the liberty of proposing that more importance should be attached to the moral education of children, a part of education almost entirely neglected by the moderns, who seem more anxious to expedite the development of the intellectual powers, and to store the minds of youth with the varied and multifarious branches of science and art, than to cultivate their moral faculties, and to direct them to the practice of virtue.

    </li>

      It sometimes happens that, by a natural bias of the system, the parts of generation, being very much developed and exquisitely sensible, soon become a centre of fluxion, towards which the vital forces become concentrated; they then mechanically and, as it were, imperceptibly draw the individual, so organized and so disposed by nature, to the commission of solitary acts, of the end or object of which he has not the slightest idea, and thus lead him, even in spite of himself, to the practice of self-pollution.

      Cases are on record where very young children have been known to apprise their friends of the sensations which they experienced, and to entreat them to adopt some means of preventing them from continually tormenting themselves; nay, I have read of several instances of children in the cradle who presented constant and violent erections, and who were thus forced to stimulate their genital organs still further by touching, suggested solely by instinct, by which they were kept in an almost permanent state of excitement.

      Now it is evident that the more nearly an individual will approach to this extreme state, in which the genital organs have got the start of the other parts of the system, the more forcibly will the causes which excite the sexual parts act on him, and occasion the melancholy effects which it is one of the objects of this treatise to pourtray.

      According to them, continual excitation of the genital organs is capable of giving rise to almost all the acute or chronic diseases which can derange or disturb the harmony of our several functions; thus fevers of different characters, various organic changes, consumptions more or less rapid, affections of the nervous system of various kinds, have been found to be the more or less fatal consequences of these excesses, excesses which have been alike condemned by the moralist and medical man.

      The best writers, however, seem more intent on giving a list of the numerous diseases which masturbation may give rise to, than in showing satisfactorily how this cause is connected with the effects observed; thus, one writer tells us that after excessive indulgence in the act of generation the stomach becomes deranged, the entire body becomes debilitated, the individual so indulging becomes pale and emaciated, the eyes become hollow, &amp;c.

      In these researches, my only guide shall be the attentive observation of facts; I shall endeavour to avoid those exaggerations which some writers indulge in; nature speaks with sufficient clearness on this matter—we disfigure the pictures which she presents to us by surcharging them, and so far from serving her cause, we weaken thereby the force of the lessons which she reads to us.

      The organic apparatus, which constitutes in either sex the genital organs, is connected by the closest sympathy with the nervous system and the digestive organs; this close connexion was indispensable for the





regular performance of the generative functions; in fact, it is by making a greater or less impression on the organs of the senses, that the individuals of one sex act on those of the other, and excite in them those ardent desires, the object of which is coition.

      The influence which the central parts of the nervous system exercise on the generative organs, and by which the latter are thrown into a greater or less state of violent orgasm, is found to possess a reflective power; the organs of generation, stimulated by the semen accumulated in their reservoirs, often throw the cerebral mass into a state of excitement, which deprives it of the power of acting freely, and renders the individual insensible to the voice of expiring reason.

      It would obviously be impossible for the strongest person to supply the excessive waste of strength occasioned by the generative act, if the frame was not plentifullysupplied with the materials of reparation duly elaborated.

      One of the circumstances most favourable to the act of generation, is the moderate stimulation of the gastric system by good food and a small quantity of alcoholic drinks.

    </li>
    <li id=505 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is in consequence of this sympathetic connexion between the digestive and reproductive apparatus, that the moderate exercise of the latter has the effect of arousing the functions of the stomach, and of rendering the appetite for food more keen, and the digestion more rapid.

    </li>
    <li id=506 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Young persons who addict themselves to excessive venery, or to the practice of masturbation, are very remarkable in this respect; they are often observed to be tormented by an almost insatiable desire of food, and eat every hour of the day, without their growth or increase making a progress at all proportioned to this excessive consumption of aliment.

      Soon, on the contrary, the paleness of their complexion, the debility and emaciation of their body, prove beyond all doubt that there exists in them an irritation, which turns off by another channel the materials of nutrition, and arrests the development and growth of the entire body.

    </li>
    <li id=508 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These preliminary considerations obviously warrant us in drawing the conclusion, that it is to the nervous and digestive systems that excessive indulgence in the habit of self-pollution directs its chief influence.

    </li>
    <li id=509 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Experience fully proves that it is to the lesion of these two orders of organs that we are to refer most of the numerous diseases which are occasioned by this baneful habit, and pathology confirms the deductions drawn from physiological observation.

    </li>
    <li id=510 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Persons who indulge in the habit of self-pollution frequently experience after each seminal discharge, or when the individual is too young, after the mere convulsion of the ejaculatory muscles, a marked sinking of the mental faculties; this debility is in several cases carried to such a degree, as to render the slightest mental attention impossible, and to force the individual to sink into profound sleep; this effect disappears after a very short time, and the cerebral functions are soon re-established; but according as the habit is of longer standing, a longer period of time is required before this restoration takes place, and eventually the entire faculty of thinking becomes completely and permanently destroyed.

    </li>
    <li id=511 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The other parts of the nervous system participate in this serious affection of the encephalon.

    <li id=512 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The organs of the senses, and more especially of the sense of vision, invariably lose their sensibility, and





ultimately become incapable of discharging their functions.

    </li>
    <li id=513 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In other individuals, the excessive exercise of the organs of generation, or their abuse, occasions mental alienation—either temporary or permanent; sometimes epilepsy is the result of this practice—this is evidently owing to the irritation of the nervous system, and there are few practitioners who have not observed cases where this affection has been produced, kept up, or aggravated by this destructive habit.

    </li>
    <li id=514 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The immoderate excitation of the genital organs occasions in this part of the system a permanent irritation, which exercises on the principal viscera of digestion an influence similar to that which the other parts of the system exercise, though it be more rapid in its effects; thus, whilst the unfortunate victim, who addicts himself to the destructive habit of masturbation, loses at once both his physical and moral powers, the alimentary canal, being sympathetically irritated, seems at first to redouble its efforts, in order to repair the excessive waste which the machine suffers; but according as the genital excitation, having now become habitual, perpetuates and increases the evil, the functions of the digestive apparatus become disturbed; extreme sensibility of the stomach, and a diarrhoea which goes on gradually increasing, announce a secondary inflammation of this viscus.

    </li>
    <li id=515 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The powerful efforts which the stomach is obliged to make, in order to compensate the wear and tear occasioned by onanism, is an important cause which predisposes this organ to irritation, and favours the effect of that sympathy which unites it to the genital system.

    </li>
    <li id=516 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I remember the case of a young man who suffered severe attacks of colic almost invariably after excessive indulgence in coition, followed by profuse diarrhoea and intolerable tenesmus.

    </li>
    <li id=517 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Such is the way in which the digestive organs are affected, in the great majority of cases, by frequent indulgence in the destructive habit of masturbation.

    </li>
    <li id=518 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In cases where there is great delicacy of the stomach and bowels, in addition to the influence directly made on the brain by the generative and digestive organs being in a state of irritation, there is experienced a feeling of general debility, arising from the inability of the stomach to discharge its functions.

    </li>
    <li id=519 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This combination of disagreeable sensations soon throws the victim into a state of profound melancholy, which it is extremely difficult to dissipate.

    </li>
    <li id=520 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Besides the action which the generative organs, in a constant state of irritation by masturbation, exercise on the nervous and digestive systems, they act with still more energy on the organs of voice and of respiration; physiologists have almost invariably remarked the close sympathetic connexion which unites the vocal apparatus to that of generation; it is well known what remarkable modifications puberty causes in the strength and tone of the voice.

    </li>
    <li id=521 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There are few persons who have not remarked what great influence excessive indulgence in coition, and more especially in onanism, exercises on the development of the organ of voice and on the extent and variety of the sounds which it produces.

    </li>
    <li id=522 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Another observation which has been frequently made is, that persons who indulge in the habit of self-pollution are remarkable for the narrowness of their chest, and the great difficulty of breathing which they experience on making the slightest exertion; almost all these unfortunate individuals are very subject either to chronic catarrhs, or more serious affections of the lungs, and are eventually carried off by pulmonary consumption.

    </li>
    <li id=523 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It would be needless to cite here cases which have occurred in my own experience, in proof of this assertion; every medical practitioner must have met instances of the same.

    </li>
    <li id=524 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In some cases, also, palpitations and organic diseases of the heart and large vessels are the consequences of the destructive habit of masturbation.

    </li>
    <li id=525 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Very slight attention to the phenomena which present themselves during the act of coition will enable us to account for such diseases being produced by excessive, and more especially by unnatural uses of the generative organs.

    </li>
    <li id=526 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      During the extreme excitation of these organs which precedes and accompanies the emission of semen, the individual seems plunged into a paroxysm of epilepsy; the face becomes red, the breathing hurried, the limbs convulsed, and the person, totally absorbed by the intensity of his feelings, becomes quite insensible to every other object.

    </li>
    <li id=527 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Now, during such efforts the blood becomes accumulated in the chest and the heart, whose action being now re-doubled, drives it forcibly through the lungs or towards the head, which then becomes violently congested, a state which has been more than once known to terminate in fatal apoplexy.

    </li>
    <li id=528 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In this way I can readily account for those sudden deaths, which occur either immediately after coition, or when coition is indulged in after a hearty meal.

    </li>
    <li id=529 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Now, during the powerful efforts which the heart makes in order to free itself from the great quantity of blood with which it is now oppressed, its hurried and precipitate action may give rise either to palpitation, more or less violent, or its cavities may acquire that organic disposition which eventually ends in aneurism.

    </li>
    <li id=530 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is then, also, that the lungs, by acting violently on the excessive quantity of blood which is sent to them, appear to contract those primary irritations, which being constantly augmented by the repetition of the same acts, will soon give rise to all the phenomena of pulmonary consumption.

    </li>
    <li id=531 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I remember the case of a patient, who, during the act of coition, was suddenly seized with so violent a palpitation, that he would have expired, had he not stopped suddenly.

    </li>
    <li id=532 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Another case is mentioned of a man, who, having married a second time at rather an advanced age, suffered, when consummating his marriage, so distressing a sense of suffocation, that he was obliged to suspend his efforts for the time; he experienced the same feeling whenever he approached his wife, and was thus completely prevented from satisfying his desires.

    </li>
    <li id=533 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To remedy this, he consulted several medical men, but without success; at last he applied to a quack, who confidently undertook his cure.

    </li>
    <li id=534 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      After having kept him under treatment for some time, he assured him that he was quite cured, and recommended him to persevere in the effort; he followed the advice ot his worthy doctor, and expired in the act.

remark, as I consider it of great importance in a practical point of view, inasmuch as in a case where the state of a patient&#39;s health causes me to suspect him or her of indulging in masturbation, the appearance and size of the parts of generation, may in many cases change our suspicions into certainty, and indicate that mode of treatment calculated to remedy the bad effects of this habit.

      It is well known that the man who addicts himself to the solitary and debasing practice of onanism is kept for a considerable time in a state of general and permanent rigidity of the entire body; this state of tension is sometimes carried so far, that very painful cramps are occasioned by it, and the fatigue which results from it obliges the individual to relax his efforts occasionally to take rest.

      It is sufficient to observe the circumstances which accompany masturbation, to see that the nervous system must be directly affected by it, not only from the violent and continued contractions which it occasions throughout the entire muscular system, but also by the prodigious tension of the imagination, which is in those cases wound up to its highest state, in order to represent to the devoted votaries of self-pollution the fantastical objects of their disgusting transports.

      Another cause which renders onanism more dangerous than excessive indulgence in coition, arises from the circumstance, that it is much easier to addict one&#39;s self to the one than to abuse the other; for when a man gives himself up without restraint to the natural pleasures of love, the fatigue felt as well by himself as by his companion, will have the effect of preventing his exhaustion; whilst on the other hand there is no bridle, no restraint on him who practises selfabuse: the former is ordinarily obliged to wait for a favourable moment to indulge in his excesses—every moment answers the purpose of the other—all he requires is mere solitude to procure his baneful gratifications: he constantly carries about him the sting which torments him; he alternately finds his imagination exciting his organs, and his organs inflaming his imagination; whilst the other, aroused only by persons of the other sex, can find an easy remedy in the absence of such.

      There is nothing to distract or take up the attention of the individual who addicts himself to onanism, whilst a thousand circumstances are constantly distracting the attention of the man who is disposed for the enjoyment of a female.

    </li>

      However, the relative dangers of masturbation arise less from the few obstacles which lie in its way, and the state of exaltation which accompanies it, than from the period of life when persons addict themselves to it.

    </li>
    <li id=574 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The various difficulties and impediments which prevent copulation before a certain age, do not exist in the case of onanism; thus, we sometimes meet it in very young children.

    </li>
    <li id=575 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Full grown boys addict themselves to the practice with the greatest passion.

    </li>
    <li id=576 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Now, let us but reflect on the consequences of such an abuse.

    </li>
    <li id=577 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The generative propensity, which under normal and natural circumstances does not show itself until the physical development of the organs is completed or at least considerably advanced, and until their condition has assumed that special character called temperament, which moreover waits until it can be legitimately gratified, and without any consequent danger; this propensity being called forth prematurely, steps in amidst all the natural efforts of growth with its unnatural train of moral excitations, sensual shocks and physical pollutions.

    </li>
    <li id=578 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A system of organs which should not have been called to the performance of its functions till a later period is thrown violently among others, whose development should naturally precede its own : it comes in to demand a portion of that strength and substance which was not intended for it, and thus to create by its influence a source of disturbance in addition to those numerous ones which beset the period of growth.

    </li>
    <li id=579 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The details now given of the effects of masturbation hold true, I admit, only when this habit has commenced at a very early period, and is frequently indulged in.

    </li>
    <li id=580 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These effects are of course less striking and are considerably modified, when the habit is less frequently resorted to.

    </li>
    <li id=581 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Still, under the most favourable circumstances, the invariable effects of masturbation is emaciation.

    </li>
    <li id=582 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Less marked in those, whose habits are otherwise good, whose constitution is lymphatic, and more especially in those who abuse themselves with moderation, it often proceeds in others to the most hideous marasmus.

    </li>
    <li id=583 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Debility keeps pace with the emaciation j at first it is felt only after indulgence in the act; but it gradually becomes more marked and more prolonged; then the individual becomes listless and indolent, indifferent to all attractions and amusement, panting and fatigued on making the slightest exertion.

    </li>
    <li id=584 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The paleness of the face, the purple tint of the eye-lids, the weakness of the pulse, and of all the organic movements in general, prove that the muscular system is not the only system affected; the powers of the heart and lungs also participate in the general exhausted state of the masturbator&#39;s system.

    </li>
    <li id=585 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      At the same time that the unhappy victim of onanism loses flesh and becomes exhausted in strength, his nervous sensibility increases more and more,—he becomes every day more sensible to external influences,—he is startled by the slightest cause; with him everything —atmospheric variations, drinking, eating, and, still more, the venereal act itself, is the source of divers sensations, annoyances and feelings of various kinds.

    </li>
    <li id=586 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He constantly complains of palpitations of the heart, oppression of breathing, dizziness, head-ache, pains and a sense of creeping along the vertebral column, numbness, cramps, a sense of lassitude, tremors, wandering pains through the limbs, and a relaxation of the penis and scrotum, as shewn in the Engravings, Plates 6 and 7





In such persons, the ordinary diseases, when they occur, soon put on a serious and alarming aspect, and present a series of symptoms of a very unusual character.

    </li>
    <li id=587 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This excessive susceptibility of the system remains with them frequently, even after they have abandoned the practice of onanism; it is often observed to attach itself to them for the remainder of their existence, and to prove the torment of their after-life.

    </li>
    <li id=588 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Epilepsy, hysteria, hypochondriasis, chorea, and the other formidable host of nervous disorders are likely to develop themselves much more readily in such persons.

    </li>
    <li id=589 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Thus, all authors who have written on these diseases are agreed in setting down masturbation among their most frequent causes, and here it would not be out of place to dissect the various effects of this deplorable habit, so ably illustrated by M.

    </li>
    <li id=590 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Lallemand, one of the most distinguished authorities on these diseases.

    </li>
    <li id=591 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He observes :—

&quot;The effects of nocturnal pollutions are generally supposed to be proportioned to their abundance, frequency, and energy of the phenomena that precede and accompany them.

    </li>
    <li id=592 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This conclusion, however, is very false; for it is generally when the emissions become less frequent and less abundant, that they are followed by serious and protracted general symptoms.

    </li>
    <li id=593 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This anomaly, however, is more apparent than real, for the nocturnal now become conjoined with diurnal pollutions, which latter likewise escape without any sensation, passing off with the urine, or when the patient is at stool, without either his knowledge or observation.

    </li>
    <li id=594 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is of importance, therefore, to warn both surgeons and patients of the errors which they are daily committing, in estimating the importance of these nocturnal pollutions only by their abundance and frequency.

    </li>
    <li id=595 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      &quot;When seminal discharges occur during the voiding the urine, or during a stool, the most serious and dangerous consequences may ultimately ensue, in consequence of their frequent repetition.

    </li>
    <li id=596 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Such patients ultimately become seriously ill; and Lallemand, whose observations I have always found accurate and faithful, says:—&quot; These patients soon become ill, their most intimate friends are ignorant of the cause of the various disorders they complain of, the medical man who possesses their confidence, is not better informed, for even the patients entertain no suspicion of the real nature of their complaint.

    </li>
    <li id=597 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Hence their indisposition is set down to ennui, tendency to melancholy, or to hypochondriasis.

    </li>
    <li id=598 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When their disease assumes a more serious aspect, then the constitution is said to be delicate, impressionable, or unhealthy; and they are looked upon as malades imaginaires.

    </li>
    <li id=599 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They are reproached with too much care of themselves, or an over-fondness for medicine.

    </li>
    <li id=600 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Medical men in extensive practice, tire of hearing the tale of so long a series of unintelligible and inexplicable maladies, and rid themselves of such patients, by recommending them to travel, or a change of air.

    </li>
    <li id=601 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Officious friends advise marriage, or some sort of occupation to fill up the void in their existence; but all blame them, because none really comprehends the nature of their disorder.

    </li>
    <li id=602 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Unfit for any serious occupation, and incapable of deep reflection, they become dissatisfied with themselves, and still more so with others.

    </li>
    <li id=603 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Absorbed in one sole tLought, they return incessantly to themselves to seek for the cause of their lamentable condition, and soon become misanthropical.&quot;

    </li>
    <li id=605 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Lallemand details two cases, the subjects of which purposely studied medicine, the one during ten, the other fifteen years, without interruption, and with the view of learning their nature of the malady ; but at the expiration of that time, they did not even suspect the cause of their suffering.

    </li>
    <li id=606 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We may judge from this of the numbers suffering from diurnal pollution, which escapes detection.

      Lallemand mentions several very remarkable instances; the two following highly interesting examples I shall transcribe from his work:—

Case—Of a military officer, who abandoned the profession of arms, to seek in the study of medicine the nature of the disease with which he was afflicted.

      Strengthened my constitution by habitual exercise in the country, substantial diet, and river bathing, and at thirteen I was as robust as any of my companions.

      At sixteen years of age I contracted a blenorrhagia (gonorrhoea), which I carefully concealed, and which disappeared slowly under the use of cold drinks, baths, and strict attention to diet, and avoiding stimulants.

    </li>
    <li id=616 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The discharge returned twice the same year after excess in new beer, since then it has frequently re-appeared after long walking, riding, or exposure to cold.

      At eighteen I obtained a rendezvous with a woman whom I liked very much; but I experienced so much agitation that I could not profit by it.

    <li id=619 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The following year, I was more fortunate with another female; but I paid dearly for the excess I committed that night: the next day the discharge re-appeared more profusely, and there came on severe inflammation with swelling of the testicles; the right epididymis remained engorged for five or six months.

    </li>
    <li id=620 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      &quot;From that time my health gradually failed; I suffered from jaundice, febrile accessions, wandering pains all over the body, and disorder of the stomach; I became extremely sensible to cold, to heat, moisture, and to every sudden atmospheric change.

    </li>
    <li id=621 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The alteration in my health induced me to give up the military profession, and apply myself to medicine to find out the cause of my suffering.

      &quot;When arrived in Paris, I found the humid moisture of the streets and of the dissecting rooms readily brought on my gleet; and sitting for a long time produced a sense of weight and heat in the perineum, with lancinating pains.

      &quot;These increased to such an extent, as to induce me to believe that I had a stone in the bladder; I felt constant pain in the fossa navicularis; I passed water very frequently and with pain; the last drops of urine were thready, glairy, producing in the neck of the bladder the feeling of a red-hot iron.

      The vacation arrived, and exercise in the open air removed all these symptoms.

      &quot;The following year I worked night and day, preparing for a concours; my digestion became deranged; diarrhoea, with straining at stool, came on.

      On going to stool, I often passed sperm in abundance.

      I wished to continue to give this the attention it deserved: so much occupied 1 felt stupid; tinkling in the ears came on; I understood nothing; I was obliged to renounce every occupation.

      &quot;The third year I suffered from palpitations, which made me fear aneurism of the heart; at a later period I felt pains in the chest, constant cough, and I persuaded myself that I was consumptive.

    </li>
    <li id=632 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      At last, ftfter my reception, I set out for home, emaciated, jaundiced, and very melancholy.

      &quot;A little time after my arrival I contracted a venereal disorder, which I treated with mercury.

      This ruined my health, and I discontinued it so soon as the external symptoms had disappeared.

    </li>
    <li id=636 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I then got a chronic gastritis, attended with obstinate constipation and deep hypochondriasis.

      &quot;I was tormented with flatulency.

      The descent of the diaphragm was prevented by the violent pain, and distension of the belly.

      I felt as if I should choke; my face became purple, copious sweat came all over the body, at last that kind of constriction ceased, and I was relieved; but for several days I felt fatigue, and my skin assumed a jaundiced tint.

    </li>
    <li id=642 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      &quot;During two years I combatted this chronic gastritis by leeches, baths, lavements, and the strictest vegetable diet.

    <li id=643 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I lived also for eight months upon milk; but all without any success.

    <li id=644 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I felt a constant desire to eat, and as soon as I took a little substantial food, I was overwhelmed by the labour of digestion.

    </li>
    <li id=645 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      &quot;At length I observed that I passed sperm during the violent efforts excited by constipation, and I was soon satisfied I likewise lost it in making water.

    </li>
    <li id=646 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      &quot;It was then only that I comprehended the cause of all my suffering.

    </li>
    <li id=647 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I obtained Sainte Marie&#39;s translation of Wickmann, I devoured it with eagerness, I learnt it by heart, I thought myself saved; but was doomed to disappointment.

    <li id=648 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      &quot;River baths, cold lotions to the perineum, produced an unfortunate impression upon the bladder and the vesiculse seminales.

    </li>
    <li id=649 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When I entered into the water, I felt a spasmodic contraction of these reservoirs, and the urine that I was obliged to pass contained an abundant flocculent cloud, owing to the presence of a large quantity of semen.

    </li>
    <li id=650 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The cold lotions produced only a momentary effect.

    </li>
    <li id=651 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      &quot;The cold clysters excited in the rectum an intolerable tenesmus, attended with pain and weight; they facilitated the expulsion of fcecal matters, by provoking contractions of the rectum; but these spasmodic contractions were soon followed by those of the vesiculas seminales, and a copious discharge of semen.

    </li>
    <li id=652 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I cannot adequately express how much injury I sustained from these cold lavements.

    </li>
    <li id=653 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      &quot;Ice, which I took internally, gave me tone for some time; it stopped the constipation, and excited energetic erections; but it soon brought on inflammation of the bladder and prostate, which disclosed itself by a painful sensation of weight at the side of the rectum, and lancinating pains behind the pubes; a frequent and irresistible desire to pass water, and a copious, abundant, glairy, puriform deposit which adhered strongly to the bottom of the vessel.

    </li>
    <li id=654 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The application of ice to the perineum and loins had the same effect.

    </li>
    <li id=655 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      &quot;Quina, spa-water, and tonics produced good effects c





for a day or two, but they soon increased the irritation of the bladder and canal, they brought back the constipation.

    </li>
    <li id=656 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      &quot;Attributing to the pressure of the faecal matters the seminal discharges which took place on going to stool, I resolved to apply the practice of Professor Boyer for fissures of the anus.

    </li>
    <li id=657 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I, myself, cut before a glass the spincters with a lithotome, which I had constructed expressly for the purpose, the expulsion of the faeces became more easy; but the seminal losses were not diminished.

    </li>
    <li id=658 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      &quot;I applied cauteries to the loins and perineum to relieve the fixed pain at the neck of the bladder.

    </li>
    <li id=659 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I tried urtication, and even a capuncture to stop the spasmodic contractions of the vesiculse seminales, which I felt very distinctly, especially when I sat down; they caused despondency because they warned me of an inevitable pollution.

    </li>
    <li id=660 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These different means succeeded for some time, but their effects were never lasting.

    </li>
    <li id=661 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I often took lavements with decoction of poppy heads to ease the irritation of the genital organs, and procure me a little repose.

      &quot;Nothing can explain the anxiety and despair these long nights without sleep caused me.

      It was always with terror that I saw the moment of going to bed arrive, and I waited the arrival of day as a blessing.

    </li>
    <li id=665 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It was particularly against this punishment that I employed narcotic lavements, but they increased the sluggishness of the rectum and the relaxation of the genital organs.

    </li>
    <li id=666 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Besides they excited violent pains in the head, and disturbed the digestive functions.

    </li>
    <li id=667 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They increased the habitual somnolency which tormented me during the day, and which rendered me incapable of any serious occupation.

      It was in this state of complete nonentity, under all these circumstances, that I arrived at Montpellier, completely disgusted with life.

      I can endure under these circumstances what I could not have borne at twenty years of age, the erections are more vigorous, and the ejaculation not so precipitate; it is accompanied by





sensations, the vivacity of which were unknown to me.

    </li>
    <li id=671 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      My intellectual functions have acquired a new vigour; if they had been in as good a state when I found myself in such a melancholy condition, my career probably would not have been so unfortunate.

      &#39;&#39; One day being rather late in setting out for his college, and fearing a severe reprimand, he began to run, but he was soon obliged to stop, experiencing all the sensations which ejaculations produce.

    </li>
    <li id=681 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It took place, in fact, although the penis was not in a state of erection; he felt at this moment a kind of fainting, which forced him to support himself against a wall till the seminal emission was completed, which was very copious.

    </li>
    <li id=682 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The same took place twice afterwards, and was always induced by fear.

      The patient thinks, that from this period he had daily pollutions, although he did not perceive them until he had been examined upon the subject.

    </li>
    <li id=684 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      And I believe he is not deceived, for although he had abandoned his habits, he experienced from that time pains and oppression of the chest, which gave him the appearance of a person being in a consumption.

    <li id=694 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In December, 1836, I saw him at the age of twenty-seven; cessation of nocturnal pollutions for two years, excessive emaciation, general prostration, loss of appetite, digestion slow and laborious, and attended with flatulency, purple appearance of the face, stupidity, faintings, disorder and confusion of the head, loss of memory; obstinate constipation lasting for five or six days; seminal discharges during the efforts at stool; sleep very short, fatiguing rather than refreshing; ringing in the ears; wandering pains causing watchfulness, and compelling the patient to walk about the greater part of the night.

    </li>
    <li id=695 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Burning pain in the head, with coldness in the lower limbs; considerable diminution in the intellectual functions; loss of memory, extreme peevishness; he could not remember old associations, even old friends, companions of his exile; desire for solitude; excessive timidity, and yet a desire for a duel, in the hope of being killed.

    </li>
    <li id=696 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Flacidity of the genitals; complete absence of the venereal appetite, and of erections; excessive sensibility of theurethra on the contact of the sound; urine disturbed, flocculent, containing a deposit similar to that of a strong decoction of barley.

    </li>
    <li id=697 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The patient&#39;s own statement:—&#39; Urine copious, I am compelled to pass it very often, the last drops thready and viscous.

    </li>
    <li id=698 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The jet is not continuous, is stopped from time to time by spasmodic contractions of the urethra, so that I am obliged to stop myself each time, before beginning again to pass urine.

    </li>
    <li id=699 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The orifice is always moist and red.

    </li>
    <li id=700 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I experienced the last fortnight a sensation as if I was passing seminal fluid, I find, from time to time, slight spasmodic movements which must result from contractions of the vesiculce seminales, for on examining the penis a few moments after, I always found the urethra filled with a copious viscous moisture.

    </li>
    <li id=701 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This sensation is felt especially when I am seated.

      &quot;&#39; Latterly, on passing my fifth examination, I finished my paper, when I heard the hour strike, which announced to me that I must send in my copy.

    </li>
    <li id=703 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The mere thought that I was behind-hand, produced immediately a very copious pollution, accompanied with a voluptuous feeling, but no erection.

      &quot;&#39;After some days of examination, on the 10th of December, 1836, I cauterized from the neck of the bladder to the bulb of the urethra.&#39;

    </li>
    <li id=705 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The following is the patient&#39;s account of the consequences of the cauterization :—

&quot;&#39;To begin, from the 20th of December up to this day, the 6th of January, I perceived in the whole of my economy, an improvement daily, and in a marked degree.

    </li>
    <li id=706 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The urine always limpid.

    </li>
    <li id=707 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The first benefit of the cauterization was the cessation of the frequent desire to pass urine; afterwards the digestion improved.

    </li>
    <li id=708 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      At present I can eat of everything indiscriminately, and I feel no longer weight or pain in the stomach.

      The epigastrium is no longer painful on pressure.

      In fine, the symptoms of chronic gastritis have entirely disappeared, constipation has in like manner ceased.

      The drivelling maniac, whose mental alienation was originally occasioned by this habit (and the statistics of our lunatic asylums prove that three-fourths of the inmates of these abodes were reduced to that state by self-pollution),— the pining and emaciated youth, hurried with accelerated speed to a premature grave,—the haggard and lack-lustre eye of the impotent victim, the pallor of whose cheek is relieved only by the self-convicting flush of conscious guilt, or the hectic flush of pulmonary consumption, fully warrant me in drawing this conclusion.

      ADDITIONAL REMARKS OF THE EFFECTS OF SELF-ABUSE ON THE SENSES.

    </li>
    <li id=724 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      As one of the principal objects which the author of this work had in view was to deter the youth of the rising generation from the baneful habit of self-abuse, and as he feels satisfied that the most effectual mode of doing this, is by pointing out in detail the direful consequences sure to be brought on all who practise it, he deems it expedient in the present edition to give an additional chapter on this very important subject.

    </li>
    <li id=725 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The effects of self-abuse may be divided into physical and moral; by physical I mean such effects as are to be recognised in the various organs and parts of the body, and in their several functions, such as the Taste, Smell, Hearing and Sight, whilst, by moral effects, I intend those which manifest themselves in the intellectual facul





ties.

    </li>
    <li id=726 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —As the physical effects On The Senses are first observed, I shall first treat of them; these effects may be thus enumerated:—

Taste.

    </li>
    <li id=727 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —The changes experienced by these patients in the organs of taste, correspond with those that are going on in the digestive organs.

    </li>
    <li id=728 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In some the appetite is disordered from the first, and when the disease has made considerable progress, the mouth is often clammy with a bitter, salt, or earthy taste.

    </li>
    <li id=729 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Food and drink appear less sapid, and do not give any agreeable sensation.

    </li>
    <li id=730 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Under these circumstances, the patients generally restrict themselves spontaneously to a vegetable diet, or even to milk.

    </li>
    <li id=731 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Smell.

    </li>
    <li id=732 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —I have paid little attention to the alterations of this function in these patients; but I have heard many complain of a notable change in their power of appreciating odours, and even of an entire loss of the sense of smell.

    </li>
    <li id=733 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Hearitvj.

    </li>
    <li id=734 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —The sense of hearing suffers more changes than the preceding.

    </li>
    <li id=735 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In general, like the others, it loses its acuteness, and this loss sometimes approaches a state of deafness.

    </li>
    <li id=736 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These symptoms vary too, according to the individuals affected, and the different degrees and oscillations of the disease, and even sometimes from day to day, without appreciable cause.

    </li>
    <li id=737 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Another annoyance felt by such patients results from the different noises they have in their ears.

    </li>
    <li id=738 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In some there is a constant whistling; in others, a sullen rumbling, like the distant roll of the drum; in others again, the noise resembles that of a waterfall, mill, &amp;c.

    </li>
    <li id=739 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Some patients hear many of these noises at the same time.

    </li>
    <li id=740 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Sight.

    </li>
    <li id=741 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —The first change produced by involuntary seminal discharges, is a diminished brilliancy of the eyes.

    </li>
    <li id=742 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These organs soon lose their brilliant, piercing expression, and appear dull, although they may not yet be either sunken or surrounded by dark circles.

    </li>
    <li id=743 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There is always more or less marked dilatation of the pupils under these circumstances, and this probably conduces to give the eyes their singular appearance.

    </li>
    <li id=744 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To the want of expression, there is also joined a timidity or appearance of shame, especially in such as practice masturbation.

    </li>
    <li id=745 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Their eyes never meet those of another with confidence; they are turned away hastily.

    </li>
    <li id=747 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There is in this uncertainty of the organs of vision, something analogous to the trembling of the voice, hesitation of speech, stuttering produced by emotion, and instability of the lower extremities, habitual agitation of the hands, palpitations, &amp;c.

    </li>
    <li id=748 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —all common symptoms in these cases.

      Importance attaches to these circumstances, because we frequently meet with patients who wish to conceal bad habits, besides which, most of those who suffer from diurnal pollutions are not aware of their existence, and hence arises a category of diseases, emanating from self-pollution, which I shall enumerate in the following manner.

      I feel, however, called on to state, that there is not a disease in the whole circle of nosology, whether of a structural, or functional nature, which may not be called into existence by indulgence in these practices.

    </li>
    <li id=768 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In enumerating the moral effects resulting from self-abuse and venereal excess, I feel myself warranted in stating summarily that there is not an intellectual faculty with which the beneficent Creator has blessed us that is not liable to be impaired by these causes.

    <li id=769 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

      If this enumeration, scanty as it may appear, is not yet enough to deter the most extravagant slave to such pernicious habits, I know not what will serve.

    </li>
    <li id=774 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Let him only for a moment consider that it is by the possession of these faculties in the perfection in which they are given to us, that man is so pre-eminently distin





guished above the brute creation.

    </li>
    <li id=775 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I shall now endeavour to trace the relation of cause and effect between these destructive habits and the several diseases ascribed to them as to their origin.

    </li>
    <li id=776 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Dyspepsia.

    </li>
    <li id=777 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —In the first place, the sciences of anatomy and physiology show that the parts concerned in the performance of the generative functions, are closely connected with the important function of digestion.

    </li>
    <li id=778 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The function of digestion is of course dependent on nervous influence, and anything like deviation from this unconscious act is one of those sorrows to which the unfortunate sensualist is devoted.

    </li>
    <li id=779 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Nature avenges herself on all who outrage her wise laws.

    </li>
    <li id=780 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The change which should take place in converting the food into nutritive matter, is entirely dependent on nervous influence, and accordingly whatever interferes with the regular distribution of this influence, must more or less interfere with this important and truly vital function.

    </li>
    <li id=781 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The sympathy subsisting between the brain and stomach with respect to the effects produced by self-pollution and inordinate venery is well known.

    </li>
    <li id=782 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The stomach however appears to be the organ which suffers first.

    </li>
    <li id=783 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The reason usually assigned for this is, that the stomach is the part of the system whose functions require the greatest perfection in the organ; hence it is that the moment any cause whatever impairs its strength, its functions are immediately deranged; hence imperfect digestion, assimilation and nutrition; and hence, the aliment, not having undergone the necessary elaboration, cannot recruit the patient&#39;s strength, already exhausted by the unnatural and inordinate expenditure of the seminal fluid.

    </li>
    <li id=784 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Hence the unfortunate victim of sensualism loses flesh rapidly; he becomes emaciated, and soon falls into a state of complete marasmus: to this debility of the digestive organ is soon added marked debility of the brain also.

    </li>
    <li id=785 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      After this, and as a consequence, the organs of the senses become deteriorated, and leave to the mind only a very imperfect exercise of its faculties:—the faculties of the memory and imagination become obliterated, and there soon remains nothing more than the mere skeleton of a man, a frightful picture of human degradation.

    </li>
    <li id=786 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This last mentioned state is owing to the c 5





exhausted condition of the nervous system, arising principally from the effects produced on the brain, on which all the functions of the mind obviously depend.

    </li>
    <li id=787 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The seminal fluid which according to some writers bears a close analogy to the animal spirits, cannot be discharged in too great quantity without producing a state of debility which must necessarily diminish the energies of the nervous system, the principal constituent of the seminal fluid being that which calls forth nervous action.

    </li>
    <li id=788 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Apoplexy.

    </li>
    <li id=789 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —The occurrence of apoplexy as a result either of self-abuse, or, as perhaps is more common, of inordinate venery, is a matter of history.

    </li>
    <li id=790 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      And indeed very slight attention will enable us readily to account for this effect.

    </li>
    <li id=791 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In coition, the action of the heart being much increased, the blood is driven with more than ordinary violence to the brain; when this occurs very frequently, the delicate structure of this organ at length gives way, and the unfortunate victim of sensuality is either carried off suddenly, or, if spared, he drags out for the remainder of his days a miserable existence with palsied limbs and impaired intellect.

    </li>
    <li id=792 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To persons advanced in years more especially, I would recommend to be most abstemious in these indulgences.

      Epilepsy.

    </li>

      —The occurrence of epilepsy, in persons addicted to self-abuse, is a thing of which I have had abundant proof since the first edition of this book.

    </li>
    <li id=796 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      That such a disease should result from frequent indulgence in this habit need not surprise any one who will but recollect the convulsive state into which the entire body is thrown after the act of self-pollution.

    </li>
    <li id=797 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The outrageous aggressions committed on the nervous system, by repeated indulgence of this kind, cannot fail to reduce this important system to the lowest degree to debility, and so to render the unhappy sensualist susceptible of the slightest disturbing impressions.

    </li>
    <li id=798 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The close connexion between the genital organs and the nervous centres are so striking, that one might almost infer d priori, if such were allowable in medical science, that excessive indulgence was perfectly adequate to the production of every species of spasmodic disease, and more especially epilepsy; and yet I have good reason to know that the general run of routine practitioners, when consulted on this form of disease, scarcely ever think of enquiring into the habits of the patient, from which one would be inclined to think that they have no idea of the possibility of such a cause giving rise to such an effect.

    </li>
    <li id=799 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Some examples, and very striking examples, of this, will be found among the cases.

    <li id=802 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —We know from anatomy that the part of the cerebral pulp where the roots of the optic nerves have their origin lie very near to the cerebellum, the seat of amativeness; hence it is not unnatural to suppose, that irritation of the genital organs might be transmitted by sympathy to the roots of these nerves, and thence by reflection to those organs of sense which they supply.

    </li>
    <li id=803 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Such a result sometimes takes place suddenly, total blindness being at once produced; in the generality of cases, however, it takes place gradually.

    </li>
    <li id=804 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Congestion of that portion of the brain near the origin of the nerves of sight, is in all probability the immediate cause of this species of blindness; a condition of brain, by the way, such as may be naturally supposed to exist in the slave of sensualism.

    <li id=805 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The best medical authorities assure us, that excessive indulgence in venereal pleasures is capable of producing dimness of vision; we need not therefore feel surprised that such an effect should be produced by the unnatural and destructive habit of masturbation.

    <li id=818 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When impotence arises from this cause, there is want of erection, and a premature discharge of the seminal fluid before the virile member has penetrated the female organs.

    <li id=820 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The habit of self-abuse induces great relaxation as well of the entire system as of the vessels of the genital organs; the latter become the seat of morbid sensibility, and great irritability, as evinced in nightly emissions, which ultimately terminates in extreme debility of the whole genital system.

      Such, however, is the power of this fertile imagination over our organs, that even when they are deaf to the appeals of the female by whom they have been exhausted, they are again re-animated and roused in favour of some other woman, who, by a single glance, imparts to them new ardour and renovated vigour, which the other was no longer able to excite.

      Should there be any grounds for suspecting that this abominable practice has gained a footing among the young pupils of a boarding-school, the strictest surveillance should be instituted over the conduct of the pupils; the use of single sleeping rooms should, if possible, be prohibited; large dormitories should always be preferred; strict discipline should be kept up; and the same precautions which are calculated to prevent the habit of self-pollution, should also be employed to prevent the repetition of the act.

      There is one remark which I think it important to make here, and that is, that certain over-precautions, injudiciously and indiscreetly adopted, may lead to bad consequences, and suggest to the innocent minds of young persons ideas which they never would have dreamed of.

    </li>
    <li id=867 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I have known that measures were adopted in a certain establishment for young persons, which were of so palpable and so injudicious a nature, as to set on foot an enquiry among the pupils as to what could have put it into the master&#39;s head to adopt them.

      If he be a person of a cultivated mind, our mode of proceeding must be of a corresponding character; it is in vain for us to dwell on the infamous nature of his conduct, or on the enormity of his crime; there is no use in pointing out to him that his habit is contrary to the laws of God and man; such moral sermons, experience tells us, have but little effect on young folk, who, even more than men of more advanced years, will be regulated in their conduct almost solely by their immediate interest.

      Point out to him, in the immediate and inevitable effects of masturbation, in that debility which always follows it, in that lassitude of body and mind which it invariably produces, the precursors of a much more alarming state; let him compare the numerous advantages of health and strength in all the conditions of life with the wretched state of both physical and moral nothingness, which is the fatal effect of onanism.

      There is one remark which I cannot here avoid making, as I think it of primary importance: it is, that light reading, which affords so much amusement to the mind, should be strictly prohibited; by its effect of exalting the imagination and debarring the individual from exercising the body sufficiently, it seems calculated to favour very strongly the propensity to onanism.

      If any books are to be allowed to persons addicted to this vice, they should be works on natural philosophy or natural history, which excite the curiosity, and may tend to incline the individual to turn his attention to experimental research, or to botanical excursions, which will thus afford him an exercise equally agreeable to the mind, and conducive to bodily health.

      It matters little what occupation the person may select; all that is necessary is, that he should work, and that a disposition to sleep soundly should thus be induced at night, which may have the effect of diverting his attention from his former depraved habits.

      With respect to those persons who, for want of education, are left as it were defenceless against the depraved habit of masturbation, it is extremely difficult to devise an effectual mode of treating them, more especially when their propensities to masturbation are very strong, and the habit of long standing, and has taken deep root.

      In such cases moral exhortations are found to be of little avail; the only means from which we can expect to derive any benefit are strict regimen, excessive exercise, and laborious employment; these may divert the mind from the objects which habitually engross its attention: it must be confessed, however, that those means prove too often ineffectual, and the evil, in spite of all our care, continues to make rapid progress.

      It will be previously advisable to seek medical advice, and if there be not more powerful objections to the measure, to endeavour to unite the unfortunate victim of onanism to an amiable woman, who may inspire him with a feeling of affection which may contravene and ultimately destroy the abominable passion for self-pollution.

      Irritation existing in the digestive apparatus, more especially in the stomach, will demand the greatest care and circumspection in the mode of living, especially in the selection of food, and also in the use of stimulants, which the debilitated state of the patient too often urges him to indulge in.

      As a general rule, it should be rigidly observed, to remove from the treatment of the diseases occasioned by onanism everything which might have a tendency, either by its action on the nervous system, or by the opportunities it might afford, to awaken the penchant for this habit.

      IMPUISSANCE.

      By impuissance, or impotence, is understood an incapacity or inability to perform the venereal act.

    <li id=904 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In a practical point of view it is important that we should not confound this with sterility, which is characterised by the presence of venereal desire and venereal powers, without, however, a prolific power.

    </li>
    <li id=905 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A sterile or barren person may possess a perfect aptitude for coition, though a total inaptitude for generation, whilst impuissance is characterised by a permanent or temporary abolition of the powers necessary for perfect copulation.

    </li>
    <li id=906 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In order to avoid all misunderstanding, we shall take care to distinguish impotence, in this place, from sterility or inability to propagate the species.

    <li id=907 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The most distinguished pathologists have agreed in classing impotence among nervous diseases, and have made the seat of the affection in man to be the corpus cavernosum, which is momentarily deprived of the afflux of blood necessary to produce an erection.

    </li>
    <li id=908 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In women its seat seems to be the vagina, which is become insensible to the venereal stimulus.

      Different Species of Impotence.

    </li>

      —This affection may, for practical purposes, be divided into absolute and relative, constitutional and local, direct or indirect, permanent or transient.

    </li>
    <li id=913 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Impotence is said to be absolute, when it depends on absence of the genital organs, or on their defective conformation.

    </li>
    <li id=914 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The absence of testicles is no impediment to amorous enjoyment.

    </li>

      Eunuchs are sterile, but not necessarily impotent.

    </li>
    <li id=916 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Among the defects of conformation of the genital apparatus, which may obstruct more or less the act of copulation, may be enumerated in the male:—1st, a phimosis—natural or accidental; 2nd, imperforate state of the gland; 3rd, excessive length of the prepuce; 4th, adhesion of the prepuce to the gland; 5th, excessive schirrous enlargement of the prostate gland; 6th, fungous growth along the corpora cavernosa; 7th, swelling of the verumontanum.

    </li>
    <li id=917 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the female:—1st, adhesion of the labia externa; 2nd, imperforate state of the vagina, or the existence of a polypus in its cavity.

    </li>
    <li id=918 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Impotence is relative when it depends on a want of proportion between the parts, which in coition should concur and correspond in the act of generation,—such as excessive size of the penis, and narrowness of the vagina.

    </li>
    <li id=919 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Impotence is constitutional when it depends on excessive frigidity of the constitution, or is a consequence of general debility affecting the entire system.

    </li>
    <li id=920 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Constitutional or connate impotence is incurable, and produces sterility; it is sometimes observed to occur in the offspring of debilitated old men, or in the offspring of those who are worn out by debaiichery and onanism.

    </li>
    <li id=921 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Long continued ill health may produce this effect in any constitution, however robust it may have originally been.

    </li>
    <li id=922 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Impotence is said to be local when a person, possessed of considerable vigour in other respects, labours under marked debility of the genital organs.

    </li>
    <li id=923 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Persons of a melancholy turn, are predisposed to anaphrodisia, or aversion to the venereal act, which state may result— 1st, from too eager desires, and too ardent an imagination; 2nd, from the fear of not meeting a mutual return of love; 3rd, from the extatic effect produced by the sight of a beloved object; 4th, by a feeling of confidence, occasioned by the pure suggestions of sincere love; 5th, by extreme nervous susceptibility.

    </li>
    <li id=924 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Impotence is direct when it results from frigidity of temperament, from general debility, or local debility of the generative organs.

    </li>
    <li id=925 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Impotence is indirect when it exists in an individual otherwise endowed with a vigorous temperament, and a natural conformation of the organs of generation, or when it is owing to a concentration of the vital powers on some one part.

    </li>
    <li id=926 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Should the afflux of blood towards the corpus cavernosum, necessary to produce an erection, be suspended, and a sudden rush of blood to the brain or heart take place from an excited or alarmed imagination, impotence will be the result.

    </li>
    <li id=927 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Impotence is permanent when the cause continues, and incessantly keeps the genital organs under its influence.

    </li>
    <li id=928 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Impotence, on the contrary, is temporary, when it depends on a physical cause, which can weaken the generative organs only for a time; or on a moral cause, which may suspend the activity of those organs, but which will cease after a time and leave them free.

      Causes of Impotence.

    </li>
    <li id=930 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —Impotence may be the consequence of particular debility of the generative organs, arising from, or occasioned by, too early venereal enjoyment, abuse of these enjoyments, or much more frequently from that still more dangerous habit, we mean that of onanism.

    </li>
    <li id=931 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the latter cause an erection no longer takes place; though the mind may still be disposed, the erector muscles, whose action is necessary for the performance of the act, are debilitated and paralysed.

    </li>
    <li id=932 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Should semen be secreted in such a case, it is thin, serous, and totally destitute of any prolific qualities.

    </li>
    <li id=933 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Anaphrodisia, owing to premature abuse of venereal enjoyment, is very difficult of cure.

    </li>
    <li id=934 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Impotence is frequently occasioned by moral causes, and more especially by affections of the mind.

    </li>
    <li id=935 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Thus it may be occasioned by fear, by suddenly conceived dislike, and other such causes.

    </li>
    <li id=936 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A sigh misunderstood or misinterpreted, a thought suggesting itself to the mind, an equivocal word, are oftentimes sufficient to destroy the illusion, and change the previously ardent feelings into absolute frigidity.

    </li>
    <li id=937 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Deep thinking, continued without intermission, may be productive of impotence.

    </li>
    <li id=938 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Hard labour, excessive study, long-continued watching, weaken the entire system, and are very detrimental to the general strength, and especially to the generative faculty.

    </li>
    <li id=939 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Impotence has been occasioned by excessive desire, and by intense love.

    <li id=940 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Indifference, and the debilitating passions may produce impotence.

    </li>
    <li id=941 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These causes act by throwing the entire system in general, and the genital organs in particular, into a state of collapse.

    </li>
    <li id=942 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Pain, disappointment, uneasiness of mind, hatred, dislike, jealousy, fear, are also causes of impotence.

    </li>
    <li id=943 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I may say the same of the fear which some individuals entertain of not being able to acquit themselves satisfactorily in performing the act.

    </li>
    <li id=944 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This is a much more frequent cause of impotence than is generally supposed.

    </li>
    <li id=945 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Extreme respect for the object of affection may also occasion a temporary impotence.

    </li>
    <li id=946 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Bad feeding, habitual and long-continued abuse of spirituous liquors may also occasion impotence; as may also the accidental, though not habitual abuse of alcoholic drinks, overloading of the stomach, etc.

    </li>
    <li id=947 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

      It may, however, be resolved; —1st, into removing from the mind everything which could unnecessarily excite the action of the genital organs; 2nd, into strengthening the system, if tone be wanting; 3rd, regulating the functions, if they seem to require it; 4th, removing muscular debility on the one hand, and nervous susceptibility on the other: or, in other words, in establishing the equilibrium between the muscular and nervous systems.

    </li>
    <li id=951 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If impotence be owing to mental or physical irritation, I should, instead of prescribing narcotics, which are so injurious to the digestive functions, recommend exercise of a moderate kind, a milk and vegetable diet, to keep the mind in a quiet and tranquil state, free from those thoughts which may light up and fire the imagination.

    </li>
    <li id=952 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Abstinence from spices and from alcoholic drinks, exercise in the open country air, and keeping the attention engaged on some useful occupation, on the good old maxim—

    <li id=953 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If, however, there be a state of atony, or want of tone in the individual, the very opposite plan of treatment will be called for.

      Cold bathing and other tonics will then be indicated.

    </li>
    <li id=955 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Should the cause of impotence be the habit of selfpollution, the first and great, nay, the indispensable rule is utterly to abandon the destructive habit, and then to adopt a strengthening diet: to banish from the imagination all those ideas and recollections which may awaken the long-indulged and still lurking propensity, and to restore the digestive and other functions which are sure to be impaired by this pernicious habit.

      When the cause of impotency is of a purely moral nature, depending solely on the feelings of the individual, and unaccompanied by any physical or bodily injury, the cure is within the reach of every one who will but attend to the necessary conditions.

    <li id=958 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Patients of this class are generally of a nervous temperament; they are easily excited, have strong feelings, and with them even the least occurrence is sufficient to cause alarm, and make them apprehend their incompetency to discharge the virile duty.

      M&#39;Dougall in his able translation of Lallemand on Spermatorrhoea, says:—

Another and very frequent symptom in cases of spermatorrhoea, is the occurrence of urethral discharge from very slight excitement.

    <li id=976 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Several cases of this kind have come under my notice, the patients having consulted me on account of the discharge.

      These cases often give rise to distressing suspicions, and much family unhappiness, especially as they often occur in married men.

    <li id=978 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The symptoms are often almost as severe as those of virulent clap, and the discharge is attended with great irritation in the neighbourhood of the prostate, and frequent desire of micturition.

    </li>
    <li id=979 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The discharge came on in one case of a married man who consulted me, after taking a single tumbler of whiskey and water at night—this gentleman not having been in the habit of taking spirits for several years, on account of continued ill-health.

    </li>
    <li id=980 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The discharge in these cases is thicker than that of ordinary clap, and sticks in patches on the linen.

    </li>
    <li id=981 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These patches may be scaled off, after which there is little mark left, and the discharge seldom penetrates through calico, so that on the opposite side of the shirt there is little or no appearance of stain.

      In most cases, indeed, connexion is impossible during the first stages of the discharge, on

      Indeed, the surgeon whose case I have just alluded to, believed himself affected by enlarged prostate—many of the symptoms of which generally accompany the discharge I have described, especially frequent desire to pass water, and a feeling as though the bladder were never&#39; completely emptied, or as though two or three drops of urine were retained in the posterior part of the urethra.

      This peculiar form of urethral discharge has hitherto, for the most part, I believe, been confounded with contagious clap; indeed, many members of our profession are in the habit of setting down all discharges from the urethra, indiscriminately, as the result of impure connection, however positive the patient may be that such has not taken place.

      Gonorrhoea consists in inflammation, more or less acute, of the mucous membrane of the urethra, or other parts of the genitourinary passages, accompanied by the secretion of a muco-purulent fluid of a yellow or greenish appearance; pain, itching, or irritation in voiding the urine, with, in the male, repeated and involuntary erections of the penis.&quot;

      Frequently there is very severe inflammation; the glans penis swells and assumes a bright red colour; the lips of the urethra become very much swollen and red; the foreskin or prepuce becomes tumid and cedematous to such a degree, as entirely to envelop the glans penis, constituting what is technically called phimosis (See Plate 9, Pig. 2), the inflammation at the time extending up along the urethra to the bladder, the mucous membrane of which is, in severe cases, involved in the inflammation; there is in this case severe pain extending along to the perinosum, and anteriorly in the region of the bladder.

      These are repeated frequently, and cause most distressing pain, in consequence of the effusion of coagulable lymph, either in the interior of the corpus cavernosum, or corpus spongiosum urethra: when the penis is erected it becomes arched or curved,—this is usually called chordee (see Plate 9, Fig 1), the part being, as it were, tied with a cord.

      The scalding felt in passing the urine is now become intolerable, and in consequence of the congested state of the vessels lining the urethra, the calibre of the canal is diminished, the urine comes out in a smaller stream, and the pain is thereby still further augmented.

    <li id=1046 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When the case is neglected, this state goes on increasing to such an extent, that the urine now comes away in drops, or, a complete retention of urine may take place, the consequence of which may be rupture of the bladder, and, ultimately, death; it sometimes happens that some few of the over-distended vessels give way, and blood passes away with the urine-; this is rather favourable, as it relieves the part.

      In this case, local means must be employed to reduce the inflammation; cleanliness is absolutely necessary; the patient must also inject some mild liquid between the prepuce and the glans, in order to prevent an accumulation of the gonorhoeal discharge, which, if allowed to remain, will irritate the delicate covering of the glans and lining of the prepuce, increasing the inflammation of those parts, and sometimes leading to serious ulcerations, as shewn in Plate 11, Fig, 3.

      Sometimes the reverse of this state takes place, and is attended with much more trouble and annoyance&#39;, called paraphimosis, as shewn in Plate 9, Fig. L This generally occurs to persons who have short pre-puces, and arises in consequence of the prepuce slipping Behind the glans, in which situation it may become swollen, and so make a stricture around the glans, causing great pain, and sometimes sloughing of the part.

    <li id=1103 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

      A lady of most exemplary and ir* reproachable character, the mother of nine children, in the seventh month of her pregnancy of her tenth child, became affected with itchings and swellings of the labia, and a muco-purulent discharge from the vagina; her husband consulted me a few weeks afterwards (having certainly had no other connexion), with severe inflammation and excoriation of the surface of the glans and prepuce, from which ooied a tnuco-purulent fluid.

      I often meet in practice with two different conditions of the urethra, which often give both patient and doctor an immensity of annoyance.

    </li>
    <li id=1135 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The first is, where a bad gonorrhoea has been so far cured as that only a few drops of discharge will remain, mixed up and diluted with the glairy transparent mucus of tha urethra; this still has the character and infecting quality of true gonorrhoeal discharge, and whilst it lasts, the patient should be peremptorily prohibited from sexual intercourse: the other annoyance is, that it will frequently happen that a man who has for months perhaps got rid of a troublesome gonorrhoea, has upon every fresh connexion a return of discharge without scalding, probably, or much uneasiness in making water; this may be controlled by injections, but on exercising or drinking wine, and more especially after connexion, it returns and annoys exceedingly all the parties concerned.

    </li>
    <li id=1136 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Here the state of the urethra should be examined with a metallic instrument, large enough to fill the,panal, without, however, putting it too much on tllfetretch.

    </li>
    <li id=1137 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This will often detect considerable irritability of the urethra, which will be removed by the introduction two or three times a week of the metallic bougie.

      The state now alluded to is what is ordinarily called gleet.

    </li>
    <li id=1140 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There is, however, another discharge from the urethra, which consists solely of the natural mucus of the canal in excessive quantity, and which is frequently attendant on a general relaxation of the system, either in consequence of excessive venereal indulgence, or of the habit of self-pollution, which has been well called &quot; the scourge of youth and the fruitful harvest of the designing quack.&quot;

    </li>
    <li id=1141 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Here, of course, I would strictly urge, as the only means of cure, a total abandonment of the cause, and early application to medical advice.

      As the disease obviously depends on a constitutional cause, mere local applications will not suffice for its removal; in fact, I know of no disease where immediate application for professional assistance is more loudly called for than in gonorrheal rheumatism; and here let me urge on the non-medical reader, by no means to trust to his own judgment, in the adoption of the curative plan of treatment here recommended for the removal of gonorrhoea, or the results might be indeed dangerous—different stages of the affection requiring diametrically opposite plans of treatment; hence the imperative necessity of consulting an experienced practitioner in even the slightest case.

      Ricord establishes three forms under which the primary venereal sore more commonly makes its appearance; in form of pustule; as a simple ulcer or chancre, then termed by the French syphilographers &quot;chancre d&#39;emblee;&quot; and as an ulcer succeeding to phlegmonous inflammation, which has been seated in a follicle, the cellular tissue, or lymphatic gland, vessel, or ganglion.

    </li>
    <li id=1167 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is also important here to remark, that the primary syphilitic ulcer has two marked and distinct stages; one of ulceration, the second of reparation or granulation; each demanding a separate and distinct treatment, both locally and constitutionally.

    </li>
    <li id=1168 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The venereal pustule, if presented to us sufficiently early, and conveniently situated, should be removed by the knife or scissors, or should the fears of the patient prevent this, it is to be opened with the point of a lancet, and the whole internal surface well cauterized with a crayon of the nitrate of silver, and afterwards treated in the manner we shall direct for the management of the primary venereal ulcer.

    </li>
    <li id=1169 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When we are called upon to treat the simple primary venereal sore during its first stage, or that of ulceration, our first object is to destroy the diseased surface, and reduce it to the condition of a simple sore.

    </li>
    <li id=1170 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This is to be accomplished by means of the nitrate of silver, with which the whole surface of the sore is to be well cauteriz3d, taking care to avoid any parts of the sore, if such there be, where the process of granulation has already commenced.

      &quot;It is,&quot; says Dr. &quot;Wallace, &quot;during the ulcerating stage of primary syphilis, or when the process of granulation has only partially commenced, that our assistance is for the most part sought; and when the disease is in this stage, there is no doubt on my mind of the propriety or practical utility of immediately applying the nitrate of silver in such a manner, as to destroy the diseased surface.

The state of the economy at large demands much attention on the first appearance of a venereal ulcer; and we must here bear in mind the golden rule of Ricord, that the varied appearances of primary venereal sores, and the characters they afterwards assume, depend very much, if not altogether, upon the natural constitution of the patient, and upon the particular condition of his health at the time he imbibes the venereal poison.

      Thus, in many instances, a primary venereal sore upon the penis produces the most intense local inflammation and fever.

      Under these circumstances, the patient must be treated upon general principles; he should be bled generally or locally, and the bowels kept freely open;

      The local inflammation and fever are first to be removed, in these cases, before we think of resorting to the nitrate of silver, and should the stage of ulceration be arrested by these means, and the sore assume a disposition to heal, it will not be necessary, or even safe, to use it at all, but the granulating ulcer must be treated in the way we shall presently mention.

      Cullerier, in the treatment of the primary venereal sore, confines his patients to bed, and keeps them upon low diet; if there be any local inflammation or fever, he bleeds them from the arm, and covers the sore with a poultice, the opiate cerate, or a strong aqueous solution of opium.

    </li>
    <li id=1184 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      All local inflammation and accompanying feyer are to be subdued before the use of the nitrate of silver; and, during the two or three days which are generally spent in its application, the patient should live low, keep his bed if possible, and take daily aperients, unless specially contra-indicated.
