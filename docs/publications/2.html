    <li id=2080 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      ANATOMY OF THE ORGANS OF GENERATION.

    </li>
    <li id=2081 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The great importance of the organs of generation, and their preservation in a state of health and vigor have been admitted by the concurrent testimony of ancient and modern writers; in fact, the due and proper performance of the special functions with which they are charged has ever been considered essentially necessary to the health and well-being of the economy, both physical and mental.

    </li>
    <li id=2082 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They are parts of admirable construction, form, and use, and constitute a striking evidence of the wonderful skill and contrivance in the adaptation of a special mechanism in the system for the performance of one of its most important and essential functions,—that of the propagation of the species.

    </li>
    <li id=2083 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Unequalled in the delicacy of their texture, and the comparative minuteness of their structure, their peculiar fitness for the functions assigned them in the economy, when they are in a state of perfect integrity, excites the astonishment and admiration, alike of the anatomist and the philosopher.

    </li>
    <li id=2084 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Their very complexity, while it renders them liable to many disorders by any of which their utility may be impaired, is wisely rendered subservient to the important purpose of separating and purifying the vivifying fluid.

    </li>
    <li id=2085 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Like that complex and delicate piece of machinery, a watch, constructed by human skill, the organs of generation in man,—a still more complex and more delicate apparatus, created by the Divine will, are liable to derangement and impairment of function and structure from many causes, the nature and effects of which will be investigated in the following pages.

    </li>
    <li id=2086 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In order however that these may be fully and clearly understood, it will, we think, be advisable to preface the observations we propose hereafter to offer respecting them by some notice of the anatomical arrangement and physiological action of the organs which are immediately subservient to the function of generation, and also of those which are only indirectly connected therewith.

    </li>
    <li id=2087 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The parts in man which are immediately connected with the function just alluded to, are, as has been already stated, of a complex nature and very delicate structure.

    </li>
    <li id=2088 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They consist of the testicles, by which the semen or seed is secreted, and of their appendages, through which the seminal fluid is transmitted to the urethra at its origin near the neck of the bladder, and of the penis or yard, by means of which the act of copulation takes place, and through a canal in the under part of which, called the urethra, the seed is conveyed from the receptacles in which it is retained, to those organs in the female, which are engaged in the function of generation.

    </li>
    <li id=2089 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The urinary organs, both in the male and female, may be regarded as subsidiary to this function, and many of the diseases to which they are liable exert a malificent influence on its performance, and not unfrequently produce impotence, either temporary or permanent, according to the nature and severity of the disease.

    </li>
    <li id=2090 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The kidneys, which are the organs solely engaged in the secretion of the urine, are glandular bodies of an oblong shape, seated on either side of the spine, upon and below the two last ribs, and behind the stomach and intestines; the right kidney is also under the liver, when the man is in the erect position, and the left under the spleen: the right kidney is generally the lower and the larger.

    </li>
    <li id=2091 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is said that these organs are more considerable in size in those persons, whose passions are very strong, and almost uncontrollable, than they are in those who are less addicted to women.

    </li>
    <li id=2092 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In shape the kidney resembles the kidney-bean; its structure is almost wholly made up of arteries and veins, with a few small branches of nerves, derived partly from those which are connected with the ribs, and thence called intercostal, and partly from a branch from the stomach, thus causing a great sympathy between those organs.

    </li>
    <li id=2093 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The arteries by which the kidneys are supplied with blood, which is partly used for the support of the organ, and partly for the secretion of urine, is derived directly from the aorta, or great artery of the body.

    </li>
    <li id=2094 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When it enters the kidney, which it does about its middle, it divides into branches, which again are divided into smaller ones, and these into still smaller, until they terminate in vessels so exceedingly minute as to be invisible to the naked eye.

    </li>
    <li id=2095 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From these the veins are formed, and by these the urine is secreted, and falls by drops into a pouch which is situated about the middle or lower part of the organ, and which forms the commencement of the ureter.

    </li>
    <li id=2096 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The vein joins the great cava vein, and discharges its blood into what is called by anatomists the great portal system, by which it is conveyed to the liver, after it has been freed in the kidney from a certain portion of its serum, and also from certain salts.

    </li>
    <li id=2097 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The nerves of the kidneys are few and small, so that the organ is not endowed with much sensation.

    </li>
    <li id=2098 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The ureters are long, hollow tubes, and constitute the continuation of the pelves of the kidneys.

    </li>
    <li id=2099 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There is one on each side of the body, and they pass downwards, and slightly inwards to the back and lower part of the bladder, which they pierce, running between its coats for about an inch, so that if the bladder should become exceedingly distended, its contents would not be forced back into these tubes.

    </li>
    <li id=2100 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They are well supplied with branches of arteries, veins, and nerves, and their sensibility in a state of disease is considerable.

    </li>
    <li id=2101 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Their use is to convey the urine from the kidney into the bladder.

    </li>
    <li id=2102 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The bladder is situated in the part of the body called the pelvis.

    </li>
    <li id=2103 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is of considerable size, and admits in some instances of distension to a degree that would hardly be credited, were it not a well-known fact.

    </li>
    <li id=2104 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This power however is not acquired without considerable risk to health and life.

    </li>
    <li id=2105 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This organ in man lies directly on the bowel, but in women the womb intervenes between it and the rectum.

    </li>
    <li id=2106 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is of an oval shape, constitutes the great receptacle of the urine, which, when it has collected to such an amount as to become a source of inconvenience, is by a voluntary effort, got rid of through the urethra,— a prolongation of the bladder, commencing at its neck, and extending along the under surface of the penis, as has been already stated.

    </li>
    <li id=2107 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The bladder is well supplied with arteries, veins, and nerves, and is very sensitive when in a state of disease.

    </li>
    <li id=2108 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It has three coats, one of them being composed of muscular fibres; its constriction causes the expulsion of the urine: it has on that account been called the detrusor urince.

    </li>
    <li id=2109 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The neck of the bladder, which in man is longer and narrower, and in woman is shorter and wider, is surrounded by a sphincter muscle, by which the continual running away of the urine is prevented, unless from disease the muscle has become useless.

    </li>
    <li id=2110 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The secretion or separation of the urine from the blood by vessels appropriated for that purpose, constitutes the principal functions of the kidneys.

    </li>
    <li id=2111 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The fluid, when secreted is carried along the ureters into the bladder,—the great receptacle in which it is retained until from its state of distension, its evacuation by the urethra is required.

    </li>
    <li id=2112 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The process by which the secretion of urine is effected is one of exceeding interest, and admirably adapted to display the wisdom of the Divine machinist.

    </li>
    <li id=2113 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The blood from which it is to be separated, is conveyed to the organ, as has been already mentioned, by the renal artery, which divides into branches supplying different parts of the organ, and these again in their turn form arches of communication with each other, whence spring minute arteries or branchlets, these again constituting a complete network of vessels by a general inosculation.

    </li>
    <li id=2114 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They terminate in the commencement of veins, and also in uriniferous tubes, by which latter the separation of the urine is effected.

    </li>
    <li id=2115 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The crypts or cryptce, small round or oval bodies, which are found everywhere in the network of vessels just spoken of, and which consist almost solely of vessels, are by some supposed to be the origin of the uriniferous tubes.

    </li>
    <li id=2116 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The tubes terminate in a mammillar process, which projects into a small membranous bag, called from its shape the infundibulum or funnel; into this bag the urine passes from the uriniferous tubes, it is thence conveyed to the larger pouch called the pelvis, and afterwards through the ureter into the bladder.

    </li>
    <li id=2117 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Several of the tubes terminate in one mammillar process, and so also several of the mammillar processes open into one infundibulum.

    </li>
    <li id=2118 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The last-named pouch, like the pelvis of the kidney, the ureters, bladder, and urethra, is defended from the acrimony of the urine by a secretion of mucus which lines and sheaths its inner coat.

    </li>
    <li id=2119 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The quantity of urine, and the celerity with which it is passed after certain fluids have been taken into the stomach, have induced in some persons a belief that vessels existed, but which have not yet been discovered, forming an immediate communication between the stomach and the bladder, unconnected with the kidneys.

    </li>
    <li id=2120 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But the quickness with which fluids can be absorbed and conveyed to the thoracic ducts, the velocity of the circulation, and the great quantity of blood carried by the renal arteries to the kidneys, will account for the celerity with which urine is separated, without having recourse to the supposition of unknown channels.

    </li>
    <li id=2121 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From the extensive communication which the nerves of the kidneys have with those of the alimentary canal, it is not improbable that the secretion of urine from the blood may commence before the absorbents have time to carry any quantity of water, received into the stomach, into the bloodvessels; nature being aware that these vessels would be overcharged, did not a separation of some of the watery fluid already in them immediately begin.

    </li>
    <li id=2122 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      That the secretion of the kidneys is much influenced by passions and ideas of the mind we need only instance in proof, the effects of fear on quadrupeds, infants, and even on adult men in suddenly increasing the quantity of urine, and producing an insurmountable desire to void it.

    </li>
    <li id=2123 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In patients labouring under some difficulty from stricture in passing urine, the mind referring to the complaint will often greatly increase the secretion of that fluid, and multiply the calls to pass it from the body.

    </li>
    <li id=2124 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This will be exemplified in a subsequent chapter.

    </li>
    <li id=2125 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The renal capsules are concavo-convex bodies, seated immediately above the kidneys, imbedded in fat, and freely supplied with blood principally from the renal artery, arising directly from the great arterial trunk, and from other vessels, Its nerves are derived from the great sympathetic.

    </li>
    <li id=2126 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the interior there is found a cavity, containing a fluid of a dark saffron colour, the use of which and of the renal capsule itself we are as yet ignorant of.

    </li>
    <li id=2127 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The prostate gland, of which we shall speak more fully, when treating of the anatomy of the organs specially concerned in generation, is in immediate connexion with the neck of the bladder; although not in fact directly engaged in the process of generation, it is more intimately connected therewith, than any of the parts which have hitherto been considered.

    </li>
    <li id=2128 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Under the same head the urethra may be regarded; it is indeed more closely connected with generation than the prostate, inasmuch as the seed-receptacles open into it, and the seed itself is ejected through it.

    </li>
    <li id=2129 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Although then the prostate and urethra constitute a portion and a very important one of the urinary organs, a description of their anatomy will be better understood, after the organs specially engaged in the function of generation, to wit, the testicles, deferent vessels, seminal receptacles, etc.

    </li>

      The scrotum or purse, is a bag of skin, divided about the middle by a septum, so as to form two cavities, in each of which a testicle is contained.

    </li>
    <li id=2132 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The situation of this septum is marked externally by an irregular line called the raphe.

    <li id=2133 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The contraction or corrugation of the scrotum, which occurs at times, is said by some anatomists to depend on the action of a muscle which they call dartos.

    </li>
    <li id=2134 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This however is denied by others who do not admit the existence of this muscle.

      The testicles, or organs which secrete the semen, are nourished and supplied with blood by long and tenuous vessels which arise from the main arterial trunk, and are called the spermatic arteries; the blood which they thus receive, serves for the elimination and secretion of the seed,—a process which is effected by the pesuliar action of the testicles, and which secreting power affixes to these organs a value and importance in the human frame, not even second to that which attaches to those generally regarded by anatomists as the more noble, being those the destruction or serious impairment of the functions of which may involve loss of life.

      In this situation they are exposed to various causes of disease, and although not absolutely deprived of the power of secreting seed, yet their action is generally more or less imperfect, in all probability from the compression they undergo, and the constant irritation to which they are subject, from the narrowness of the canal by which they are in fact somewhat elongated and flattened, and smaller than usual.

      The blood which is thus conveyed to the organs, after having been employed by the testicles for the separation and secretion of the seed, is re-conveyed in a refuse state by other vessels, called the spermatic veins, back to the general circulatory system in the body.

    <li id=2162 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They pass obliquely downwards and outwards, behind the peritoneum, and are contained in a common protecting sheath with the veins, forming with the nerves of the testicles what is called the spermatic chord; they then run over the psoas muscles and ureters, and pass out through the rings of the abdomen and abdominal canal, over the os pubis or share bone, and into the scrotum, which the spermatic artery enters, and, as already remarked, supplies the testicle.

      They are exceedingly tortuous in their course, and freely anastomose with each other, while in the lower part of the cord, but these inter-communications cease after they have entered the abdominal canal, on leaving which while crossing the psoas muscle, they unite together, and form one vein, which on the right side terminates in the lower vena cava, and on the left in the vein which arises from the kidney on that side.

      The testicles are generally two in number, one on each side of the scrotum or purse, but cases have been published in which there has been only one testicle, and others again there have been found three, four and even, although very rarely, five testicles.

      Some few instances however have been published by modern authors, and in some of these the facts having been examined after death, the non-existence of one of the testicles has been clearly ascertained.

    </li>
    <li id=2185 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Instances also have been known in which the unhappy sufferers have been eunuchs from birth, having been born without either testicle.

      The tunica vaginalis or investing membrane of the testicles which has been already alluded to, consists of two layers, the inner one directly enveloping the testicle.

    </li>
    <li id=2188 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It secretes a kind of semen, which serves to lubricate it.

    <li id=2191 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In such instances there is the double danger of the occurrence of what is called congenital rupture, and also of the extension of severe inflammation from the cavity of the vaginal tunic to the abdomen.

    </li>
    <li id=2192 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Between the testicle and the tunica vaginalis, there is another tunic or coat called the tunica albuginea, which is smooth, white, and inelastic, composed of fibres and structure.

    </li>
    <li id=2193 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It completely covers die testicle, but not the epididymis.

    <li id=2194 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      At the upper, back, and outer part of the organ, it forms a projecting body containing the blood vessels, and part of the glandular structure of the testicle, as well as the seminal canals of the rete.

    </li>
    <li id=2195 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Astley Cooper called it mediastinum testis.

    </li>
    <li id=2196 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The unyielding character of its tunics is the cause of the intense pain which is experienced, when the organ is swelled and inflamed.

    </li>
    <li id=2197 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The testicle is also invested and protected by a muscle called the cremaster, which is formed partly by some of the fibres of the oblique muscles of the abdomen, and partly arises from the lower part of the spine of the ilium, and from the pubis.

    </li>
    <li id=2198 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It acts as a third coat or tunic to the testicle.

    </li>
    <li id=2199 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It expands all round the tunica vaginalis, which it closely embraces, forming a hollow muscle, within which the testicle and its tunics are contained, and which, when it is in action, contracts and draws the organ it encloses upwards to the abdomen, sustaining and compressing it, and forcing out along the vas deferens the semen previously secreted by the organ.

    </li>
    <li id=2200 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The action of this muscle is principally involuntary, but it has been found in some few instances to be under the control of the will.

    </li>
    <li id=2201 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The cremaster muscle is small and indistinct prior to puberty; after that period it is greatly developed in persons who are very muscular, and is exceedingly well marked in cases of old rupture or hydrocele.

    </li>
    <li id=2202 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It has been already observed that the substance of the testicle consists of an infinite number of small tubes, which are called the tubuli seminiferi, or seminiferous tubes.

    </li>
    <li id=2203 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These are very numerous; their number has been calculated by Lauth at 840, and their entire mean length at 1750 feet, the mean length of each duct or





tube being twenty five inches.

    </li>
    <li id=2204 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They communicate readily with each other, and thus constitute one vast network of communication.

    </li>
    <li id=2205 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Their calibre is of varying diameter in different individuals, and is also modified by the age of the party, and the state of activity or of rest of the organ itself.

    </li>
    <li id=2206 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They are much larger in an active adult in the prime of life, while the organs are in full vigour, than they are in the child or old man.

    </li>
    <li id=2207 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They differ occasionally also in the testicles of the same individual, the calibre of the seminiferous tubes in the one testicle being greater than that of the other.

    </li>
    <li id=2208 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In their course in the body of the organ, they converge towards the part described as the mediastinum; then two or more tubes unite, and form a conical lobe, the point of which opens into the mediastinum testis.

    </li>
    <li id=2209 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Of these lobes there are between four and five hundred in each testicle.

    </li>
    <li id=2210 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The epididymis, which, it has been stated is seated at the upper and back part of the testicle, is the continuation of the numerous seed-bearing tubes; it descends along the back of the testicle, gradually becomes larger in diameter, but less convoluted until it begins to ascend, when it obtains the name of vas deferens.

    </li>
    <li id=2211 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is longer than the testicle, being about two inches in length, and four or five lines in width.

    </li>
    <li id=2212 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It consists principally of seminal canals from which arise in the after part of the rete testis, the vasa efferentia, or efferent vessels, of which tubes there are generally twelve in number, although there be sometimes as many as thirty.

    </li>
    <li id=2213 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      All these ducts, after numerous and close convolutions, unite with or rather terminate in the canal of the epididymis.

    </li>
    <li id=2214 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Their average united length has been estimated by Lauth at nearly eight feet, the separate length of each being rather more than seven inches.

    </li>
    <li id=2215 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The parts of the epididymis known as its body and tail, are composed of the convolutions or twistings of its canal.

    </li>
    <li id=2216 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This latter is very irregular in size and length, averaging generally when unfolded and drawn out about twenty feet.

    </li>
    <li id=2217 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It varies greatly both in length and calibre in different individuals.

    </li>
    <li id=2218 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The walls of this canal, unlike those of the vasa efferentia, are very strong, and will bear considerable violence.

    </li>
    <li id=2219 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It terminates in the canal called the vas deferens or deferent vessel, the excretory duct of the organ, and is generally narrower in calibre at the part where it unites with the vas deferens, than in any other part of its course.

    </li>
    <li id=2220 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There is sometimes a blind canal found connected with the epididymis or deferent vessel, which has been called by Haller the vasculum aberrans.

    </li>
    <li id=2221 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is as large in diameter as the canal of the epididymis, and is generally from eight to fourteen inches long, although it only passes along the cord for two or three inches, when it either terminates in a dilated extremity, or else gradually diminishes in size, and finally disappears.

    </li>
    <li id=2222 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is much convoluted in its course.

    </li>
    <li id=2223 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is not of unfrequent occurrence, although in perhaps the majority of instances it is not present.

    </li>
    <li id=2224 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      As many as three vascula aberrantia have been found.

    </li>
    <li id=2225 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But little is known of the real use to which this blind canal is subservient in the economy.

    </li>
    <li id=2226 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      By some it has been supposed to be a supplementary vas deferens; others again conceive that its office is merely the secretion of a fluid to assist in lubricating the part composing the epididymis,—while others again regard it as a mere diverticulum, accidental in its formation, such as is occasionally met with among the intestines.

    </li>
    <li id=2227 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The vas deferens or deferent vessel, the excretory duct of the testicle, forms a constituent part of the spermatic cord, and is readily distinguished from the arteries, veins, nerves, and absorbents by its cartilaginous feel.

    </li>
    <li id=2228 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is firm and round in shape, and it has been supposed that its parietes or walls were muscular.

    </li>
    <li id=2229 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is continuous with the under part of the epididymis, and ascends along its inner side, forming numerous convolutions until it passes beyond the testicle, when it joins the spermatic vessels and nerves to form the cord.

    </li>
    <li id=2230 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It then enters and passes through the abdominal canal; after which it leaves the cord and plunges into the pelvis, passing backwards in the form of an arch on the outside of the peritoneum, to which it adheres; it passes first by the side of, and then behind and below the bladder, inclining gently inwards in its course, towards the cervix of that viscus, until at last, about the base of the prostate gland, it comes in contact, but does not communicate with the vas deferens of the opposite side.

    </li>
    <li id=2231 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It terminates in the seminal vesicle, immediately above and behind the prostate, and with it forms the ejaculatory canal, which perfoiates the prostatic part of the urethra.

    </li>
    <li id=2232 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      As the vas deferens approaches its termination in the seminal vesicle, it increases in breadth and capacity, becoming again gradually smaller as it reaches the prostate.

    </li>
    <li id=2233 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The testicles in the foetus are situated in the abdomen, posterior to its lining membrane the peritoneum, immediately below the kidneys, and in front of the psoas muscles.

    <li id=2235 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Connected with each of these organs while in the foetal state, is a soft solid body of a conical shape, which is called the gubernaculum.

    </li>
    <li id=2236 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

    <li id=2237 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It passes out of the abdomen in the course taken by the testicle, through the inguinal canal and the abdominal rings, downwards into the scrotum, to which it is attached.

    </li>
    <li id=2238 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

    <li id=2239 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The testicle between the fifth and sixth month of fcetal life, is gradually drawn by the contraction of the muscular fibres enveloping the gubernaculum and by the action of the cremaster muscle from its situation near the kidney, upwards towards the internal abdominal ring.

    </li>
    <li id=2240 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Towards the close of the seventh month it is generally found at the ring, traverses the inguinal canal during the next month, and finally towards the close of the period of pregnancy, is generally to be discovered in the scrotum.

      Mr. Hunter was of opinion that the organs under these circumstances would be necessarily very imperfect, and perhaps even utterly unserviceable for the purposes for which they are designed by nature, but the only ease which came under his notice in man, in which both testicles were retained in the abdomen proved the contrary of his position, since the individual had all the powers and passions of a man.

      The fact that injuries of a severe nature affecting the back part of the head are followed by such a result would tend to support the views of the phrenologists that the seat of sexual desire is in the cerebellum, which is there located, and between which and the organs of generation they say there is great sympathy.

      So much similitude is there in the structure of the brain and of the testicle, as well as a most extraordinary sympathy between them, that experience in the course of a practice extending through a series of years, has demonstrated that there are many cases where the human mind suffers under a species of derangement, in consequence of diseases of the organs of generation, especially a tabes dorsalis, and for this solid reasons may and will hereafter be given.

      The junction of the two vessels which form this common duct is such, notwithstanding the acuteness of the angle, that air gently thrown into the vas deferens by a blow-pipe, will inflate the seminal vesicle before it enters the urethra, but if thrown in with violence, it will immediately inflate both the urethra, and the seminal vesicle.

      He therefore concluded that the seminal vesicles did not serve as receptacles for semen, but simply secreted a kind of mucus of their own; and although their peculiar use had not been ascertained, it was, he thought, reasonable on the whole to conclude, that they were together with other parts, subservient to the purposes of generation.

      There is no anatomical or mechanical structure calculated to prevent such occurrence; for, notwithstanding the acuteness of the angle between the two vessels at their junction, from the length of the common tube, the wideness of that part of it formed by the vesicle where the two vessels meet, and the very small aperture by which it opens into the urethra, the fluid (which from the length and contortion of the seminal tubes, must pass very slowly from the testicles) will insinuate itself much more readily through the large communication with the vesicle, than through the very small one with the urethra, unless it be prevented from so doing by the vesicle attempting to throw its contents into the urethra at the same time.

    </li>
    <li id=2387 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      During coition this attempt is made, and both fluids pass at once into the urethra, where the fluid secreted by the vesicles being added to that coming from the testicles by the deferent vessels, between them a proper quantity is produced to distend sufficiently the sinus of the urethra, that the muscles of ejection may act on its contents with more power.

      In the dead body it has often been found that air or any fluid when not thrown into the vas deferens with much force, will fill the vesicle before it enters the canal of the urethra, and on examining the contents of the vesicles, although the fluid contained near the fundus differs in color, consistence, and smell from the semen, yet that found near the neck is often very similar to it; or to the fluid contained in the enlarged extremities of the deferent vessels.

      From the frequent excitement of the passions and their gratification being denied in the civilized state of human society, fluid must often be secreted in the testicles at times when it cannot be naturally evacuated; and although the accumulation of it in this organ sometimes produces tension and pain, the fulness of the vessels often subsides without these unpleasant symptoms having taken place.

    </li>
    <li id=2391 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Thus, when the vis a tergo no longer drives the semen slowly on, the muscular properties of the vas deferens may assist in conveying that fluid on towards the vesicles, which may receive it until the time of ejectment arrives.

      They may thus, under particular circumstances, more likely to occur in the human species than in brutes, be employed as reservoirs, although their ordinary use may be to secrete a fluid which mixing with the semen during coition, may render the act more perfect, and more likely therefore to produce fecundation.

      Aji additional reason may be adduced in support of the theory that the seminal vesicles act as reservoirs for the seed in man, in the well-known fact that animals possessing a penis, but destitute of seminal vesicles, remain for a long time in sexual contact, because the fluid necessary for fecundation, from the long course it has to take during copulation, only flows from the urethra drop by drop.

Lawrence, in his lectures on the physiology of man observes; &quot;because the vesiculae seminales in some animals, do not communicate with the vasa deferentia, and therefore cannot receive the fluid secreted in the testicles, it has been inferred that they do not serve the purpose of reservoirs for the seminal secretion in man; where however they have so free a communication with the vasa deferentia, that any fluids pass into and even distend the former, before they go on into the urethra.

    <li id=2431 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The sooner the patient gets this relaxed state of the gland restored the better.

    </li>
    <li id=2432 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We have sometimes been consulted where surgeons had been treating the patient as if this humour from the prostate gland was venereal.

    </li>
    <li id=2433 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Errors of this kind have done great mischief.

    </li>
    <li id=2434 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This humour flows from the prostate gland only, and it distils slowly without any ejaculation, contrary to the semen, from which it differs.

    </li>
    <li id=2435 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Hence we observe, that this humour is not wanting in eunuchs, when they have an erection; and the same liquor sometimes distils from geldings when they strive to leap.

    </li>
    <li id=2436 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This secretion, which appears like semen in castrated animals, is absolutely unprolific, and destitute of every virtue for procreation.

    </li>
    <li id=2437 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But although it does not contain any prolific virtue, yet good semen is not formed when those parts are corroded; so that great caution should be observed, by all those entering the marriage state, to be well assured that this humour of the prostate gland is in a sound and healthy state; for various evils may arise in consequence, and especially sterility.

    </li>
    <li id=2438 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Many a fine estate has been deprived of an heir, as well as titles made extinct, from that cause, the true condition of things, perhaps, having never been discovered.

    <li id=2439 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Healthy men continually separate semen from the blood, which being retained and inspissated, like the white of an egg or starch, would be almost immoveable, if it were not for the more thin juice of the prostate gland, when in a sound state, which mixes with it and serves to lubricate the urethra almost like an oil.

    </li>
    <li id=2440 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Besides this, as the animalcule must stay a long time, perhaps, before it arrives in the uterus or womb, it seems necessary for it to be provided with a suitable aliment; for, unless nature nourished the animalcule, when formed, it would certainly perish or become extinct: and this nutritious liquor is that of the prostate gland, which in some animals is larger than are the testicles themselves.

      Cowper&#39;s glands, which are situate between the bulb of the urethra and the membranous portion, are about the size of two small garden peas.

    </li>
    <li id=2442 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They open into the canal by two small ducts, and appear to secrete a mucus which serves to lubricate the urethra.

    </li>

      The urethra, a membranous canal extending from the neck of the bladder to the end of the penis or yard, is divided into the prostatic, membranous, bulbous, and pendulous portions.

    </li>
    <li id=2445 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Its coats are the same as those of the bladder; of which it is apparently a prolongation.

    </li>
    <li id=2446 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The first or prostatic portion, commencing immediately from the neck of the bladder, is surrounded by the prostate, which it enters on the upper and anterior surface, a little more forwards than the notch at the base, and proceeds in a slightly incurvated direction onwards towards the pubes.

    </li>
    <li id=2447 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      On the under part of its internal surface, there is found a prominent projecting body, called the caput gallinaginis or verumontanum, on the sides of which the common ducts of the deferent vessels and seminal vesicles open into the canal, as also the ducts of the prostate.

    </li>
    <li id=2448 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The portion of the urethra between the prostatic and bulbous portions, is called the membranous, and the reason that has been alleged for this is, because its circumference is less than that of any other part of the canal.

    </li>
    <li id=2449 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Its length is generally about an inch, when the penis is in a state of erection; when otherwise, it is somewhat less.

      It is cylindrical in form for about half its length.

    </li>
    <li id=2451 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The urethra soon after takes the name bulbous, when it meets with the pendulous portion of the bulb, the substance of which however it does not enter until it reaches the arch of the pubes.

    </li>
    <li id=2452 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

    <li id=2454 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The urethra at this part enlarges somewhat at its under part, forming a kind of sinus, in which it has been supposed the semen may accumulate, until a sufficient quantity has been collected.

    </li>
    <li id=2455 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The canal afterwards bends forwards and is surrounded by the spongy bodies, through its course along the under surface of the penis.

    <li id=2456 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The whole of the internal surface of the urethra is abundantly supplied with mucus to defend it from the acrimony of the urine.

    </li>
    <li id=2457 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is secreted partly by vessels which form small projections on the inner surface of the canal, and partly by glandular structures situated at the bottom and sides of the very numerous lacunas or depressions dispersed over every part of the internal membrane, the openings of which are directed towards the termination of the urethra, so that the mucus is pressed out of their cavities by the urine as it flows from the bladder.

    </li>
    <li id=2458 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These lacunae vary much in size, the largest being found in greatest numbers on the upper surface.

      Its membranes are very thin, and almost transparent and without fibres, so that in itself it does not possess the power of muscular contraction and relaxation.

      The penis consists of the cavernous bodies, (corpora cavernosa) and of the spongy body (corpus spongiosum) the latter terminating in the gland or glans.

    </li>
    <li id=2466 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These are enveloped in a loose folding of common integuments.

    </li>
    <li id=2467 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The cavernous bodies commence by two bodies called the crura, one on each side of the ischia; they unite below and in front of the arch of the pubis, and constitute the upper part of the penis, in the upper groove there being a large vein, two arteries, nerves, and absorbents, and in the lower, the spongy body surrounding the urethra.

    </li>
    <li id=2468 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The corpus spongiosum begins at the bulb in the form of an oblong swelling of a pyriform shape.

    </li>
    <li id=2469 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is incurvated forward, gradually becoming narrower, until it reaches the groove on the under part of the cavernous bodies; it then becomes cylindrical in shape, until it assumes a conical form when terminating in the glans penis.

    </li>
    <li id=2470 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      According to some anatomists it consists simply of a congeries of veins freely communicating with each other, while in the opinion of others it consists of cells formed and divided by a trellis work from each other, similar in structure to the cavernous bodies, but on a less scale and more regular.

    </li>
    <li id=2471 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The convex conical surface of the gland is covered by a fine membrane, in colour resembling the red part of the lips.

    </li>
    <li id=2472 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      At its base or corona there are rows of projecting papillae which secrete a sebaceou matter having a peculiar smell.

    </li>
    <li id=2473 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The gland, which possesses exquisite sensibility, is protected by the loose covering called the prepuce or foreskin, which is tied to the penis immediately below the orifice of the urethra, by the band called the fraenum : this limits the motion of the prepuce and tends to keep it in its proper place.

    </li>
    <li id=2474 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The spongy substance of the urethra, which forms the glans penis, is covered externally with an exceeding thin membrane or cuticle, under which are placed the very sensible nervous papillas, which are the chief seat and cause of pleasure and pain in this part.

    </li>
    <li id=2475 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We may now understand why many, in the venereal act, have not the glans distended, though the whole penis is, at the same time, turgid; because the glans belong entirely to the cavernous body of the urethra; and if that body be paralytic or weakened from any preceding or existing cause, which we have known often to proceed from irregular practices; in all those people where the spongy body of the urethra is not distended, impotence will arise, which if not perfectly understood, cannot be cured by any physician.

    </li>
    <li id=2476 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Whereas, in healthy men, when these organs are in due tone, during the orgasmus veneris, or the moment before the semen is ejected, the glans and whole cavernous body of the urethra are extremely turgid, so as to be ready to burst; but soon after a kind of convulsive motion follows, and the semen is discharged with a slight loss of strength for a little time throughout the whole body, which soon recovers its usual vigour.

    </li>
    <li id=2477 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      During coition the corpus spongiosum and glans penis are rendered turgid by the blood filling their vascular structure, and the whole canal of the urethra is lengthened, but made more narrow and straight.

    </li>
    <li id=2478 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The seed is gradually deposited in the sinus of the bulb; the glans being placed at the other extremity of the corpus spongiosum, and endowed with a peculiar sensibility, when a sufficient quantity of semen is collected, excites the muscles covering the bulb to action, and the contraction of the fibres taking place, the semen is propelled rapidly along the canal; the blood in the bulb is at the same time pressed forwards, but requiring a greater impulse, it forms an undulatory wave behind the semen, narrowing the urethra, and urging on the semen with increased force.

    </li>
    <li id=2479 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The corpora cavernosa are covered by a white elastic ligament of some thickness, and not very vascular, and are separated by a perforated septum, which allows the blood contained in the cellular structure to pass readily through its openings from one to another.

    </li>
    <li id=2480 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They consist of numerous cells of very irregular size and shape, bounded by a net-like membranous substance which allows of as ready a communication between the cavities as does the septum.

    </li>
    <li id=2481 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The cells of the corpora cavernosa have been thought to be more or less muscular, and it is said that in the horse they are evidently so.

    </li>
    <li id=2482 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These bodies are supplied with blood by branches from the pudic, which sub-divides into small vessels, and are distributed everywhere throughout their structure.

    </li>
    <li id=2483 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When the passion of desire does not exist, the blood is not poured out into the cells, but returns by the veins as usual, and the penis remains flaccid; but when a person is under the influence of particular impressions which excite the nerves of these parts, the minute arterial branches which before had their orifices closed, have their action suddenly increased, and pour from their open mouths the blood into these cells, so as to distend them, of course overcoming the elastic power that under ordinary circumstances keeps them collapsed.

    </li>
    <li id=2484 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In this way the penis is rendered fit to convey the semen to the female organs of generation.

    </li>
    <li id=2485 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The erection of the penis is greatly aided by the action of certain muscles called the erectors of the penis.

    </li>
    <li id=2486 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The great vein of the penis is formed by branches from the gland, sides of the corpus spongiosum, and common integuments, runs along the back of the penis in the upper groove to its root, where it divides into two vessels which pass under the arch of the pubes, receive other veins from the prostate and bladder, and empty themselves into the internal iliac.

    </li>
    <li id=2487 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The absorbents of the penis are very numerous, and terminate in the glands of the groin.

    </li>
    <li id=2488 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The nerves are derived from the lumbar and sacral nerves, and from the inferior mesenteric plexus.

      This chapter will be most appropriately terminated by some observations on puberty, and the changes it effects in the system.

    </li>
    <li id=2490 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The approach of puberty induces marked changes in the general system of man, as well as in the local organs which are subservient to generation.

    </li>
    <li id=2491 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The growth of hair on the chin, upper lip, and sides of the face, and on the pubes, the peculiar alteration of the voice, the greater firmness of muscle, the extraordinary change in the passions and feelings, together with the great increase in the size of the penis and testicles, shew the advent of a peculiar change in the system, by which it is adapted for the propagation of the species.

    </li>
    <li id=2492 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The desire for connexion with the female, implanted in man by nature for a wise purpose,

E





becomes developed after the period of puberty, and the organs by which the act is performed, gradually assume their full vigor and dimensions.

    </li>
    <li id=2493 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The age at which the peculiar changes in the organism called puberty takes place varies in different climates and in different constitutions.

    </li>
    <li id=2494 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is also influenced by the mode of life and circumstances of the individual.

    </li>
    <li id=2495 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The period of puberty occurs earlier in warm than in cold climates; in temperate countries, it takes place from the fourteenth to the seventeenth year; the passions of youths living in large cities and towns are however excited earlier than are those of the agricultural population, on account of the greater sources of temptation to which they are exposed.

    </li>
    <li id=2496 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In those animals which are not endowed with reason to guide their actions, the desire for copulation occurs periodically, and in some the testicles increase in size until the season of procreation is over, and then decrease, and continue small, until the commencement of the next season.

    </li>
    <li id=2497 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Evidence of this may be readily found in the testicles of the cock-sparrow, which progressively increase in size from January till the end of April, when the love season of these birds usually terminates.

    </li>
    <li id=2498 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The increase and diminution of these organs however do not take place in birds only, but has been discovered in many other animals, more especially in the land-mouse and mole.

    </li>
    <li id=2499 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There are several reasons which might be alleged for the existence of a periodical desire for copulation among animals—were it otherwise, as the passion for sexual intercourse is very powerful, and animals do not possess the light of reason so as to be enabled to restrain or subdue their passions, it is probable that from its excessive indulgence, all their other habits might be lost, and even the necessity of providing for their present and future wants might be forgotten; besides which in those animals which are very fruitful, and which do not long carry their young, their number would be in a short time exceedingly great, far beyond the means of support that nature has provided for them.

    </li>
    <li id=2500 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Another reason might be alleged, that were domestic animals always in heat, they would be of comparatively little service to man, while the flesh of wild ones would be too coarse and rank, and altogether unfit for the purposes of nourishment.

    </li>
    <li id=2501 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The period of the year during which the desire for copulation principally exists in animals is that of spring —few experience any sexual desire during the winter, except the frog, wolf, and fox; the severity of the cold seems to destroy, at least for the time, all such feelings.

    </li>
    <li id=2502 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      On the other hand, in climates where the summer is very hot, the genital organs of animals then become so much relaxed in tone, as to render them unfit for the proper performance of the necessary act.

    </li>
    <li id=2503 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The case is however somewhat different in domestic animals; the passion is less periodical, the secretion of semen not being arrested by cold, to which they are much less exposed, and the circumstances in which they are placed being altogether different.

    </li>
    <li id=2504 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In man the desire for procreation arises at puberty, and may and can be indulged in, if health and the requisite powers continue, at all times and seasons of the year.

    </li>
    <li id=2505 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Being endowed by nature with the high, the exalted function of reason, he is left a free agent, having the full power to use or abuse his capabilities, with the consciousness that if he do abuse the functions with which he is gifted, he must abide the penalty.

    </li>
    <li id=2506 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Man is not affected by changes of temperature as are the wild animals, either as respects excessive heat or intense cold, and consequently the human testicles are generally the same in dimensions after puberty throughout the year.

    </li>
    <li id=2507 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The desire for sexual intercourse in man begins after puberty, and is consentaneous with the secretion of semen or seed by the testicles.

    </li>
    <li id=2508 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is preposterous to say it depends on the occurrence of that secretion, as both the passion for copulation and the secretion of semen are but indications of the great change which takes place in the system at that epoch.

    </li>
    <li id=2509 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It does not however exist before the testicles begin to enlarge in size, and perform their proper function, and it is said, but untruly, to be lost when the operation of castration has been performed.

    </li>
    <li id=2510 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Those eunuchs only are not influenced by the desire for procreation who were deprived of the organs of generation prior to puberty; those who were castrated subsequent to that event, still entertain the desire for intercourse, although in a less degree than men who have all their organs entire.

    </li>
    <li id=2511 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Desire is more languid in advanced age than during the period of the adult life; the seed is then more sparingly secreted, and indeed all the functions of the system are performed in a less energetic manner, although, as will soon be shown, old men are not in every instance deprived of the power of generation.

    </li>
    <li id=2512 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Desire is also very moderate in persons who have small organs, and occasionally it is altogether absent.

    </li>
    <li id=2513 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Spermatozoa have been discovered in the testicles of men upwards of seventy years of age, and on one occasion in the organs of a tailor, who died as the age of eighty-seven.

    </li>
    <li id=2514 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There are even circumstances on record of persons retaining the procreative faculty to the age of one hundred years; but in these cases, as in the well-known instance of old Parr, the general bodily powers were also preserved in an extraordinary degree.

    </li>
    <li id=2515 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In speaking of this function, and of its exercise, Dr. Carpenter in his Principles of Human Physiology observes,—&#39; To the use of the sexual organs for the continuance of his race, man is prompted by a powerful instinctive desire, which he shares with the lower animals.

    </li>
    <li id=2516 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This instinct is excited by sensations; and these may either originate in the sexual organs themselves, or may be excited through the organs of special sensation.

    </li>
    <li id=2517 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Thus in man it is most powerfully aroused by impressions conveyed through the sight or touch i in many other animals the auditory and olfactory organs communicate impressions which have an equal power; and it is not improbable that in certain morbidly excited states of feeling, the same may be the case in ourselves.

    </li>
    <li id=2518 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      That local impressions have also very powerful effect in exciting sexual desire must have been within the experience of almost every one; the fact is most remarkable however in cases of satyriasis.

    </li>
    <li id=2519 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This disease is generally found to be connected with some obvious cause of irritation of the generative system, such as pruritus, active congestion, etc.

    </li>

      The instinct (for sexual intercourse) when once aroused, (even though very obscurely felt,) acts upon the mental faculties and moral feelings, and thus becomes the source, though almost unconsciously so to the individual, of the tendency to form that kind of attachment towards one of the opposite sex, which is known as love.

    </li>
    <li id=2521 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This tendency cannot be regarded as a simple passion or emotion, since it is the result of the combined operations of the reason, the imagination, and the moral feelings; and it is in the engraftment (so to speak) of the psychical attachment upon mere corporeal instinct that a difference exists between the sexual relations of man and those of the lower animals.&#39;

      ONANISM AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.

    </li>
    <li id=2585 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The practice of the solitary vice, onanism, manustupration or masturbation has been condemned by all writers, whether medical men, philosophers, or divines, from the earliest ages of mankind.

    </li>
    <li id=2586 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      One of its names, onanism, is derived from the saddening example of Onan the second son of Judah, who was struck dead by his Creator for the commission of this heinous sin.

    </li>
    <li id=2587 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In other places in Scripture, allusions are made to this dangerous practice, and fearful denunciations are announced against those who are guilty—denunciations which are fully carried out in the wretchedness of health both of body and mind, which follow its commission.

    </li>
    <li id=2588 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Man cannot err against the dictates of nature, without paying a severe penalty for his lapse sooner or later.

    </li>
    <li id=2589 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The penalty exacted for onanism is one of the most serious and awful nature.

    </li>
    <li id=2590 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It involves a gradual exhaustion of the powers of mind and body, and an early death, attended with every suffering that man can endure.

    </li>
    <li id=2591 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Every function of the system becomes disordered and diseased; and at last the wretched victim of error perishes in a state of misery too fearful to contemplate.

    </li>
    <li id=2592 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The exhaustion of the system, caused by excessive evacuations of any kind, is constantly shewn by the results of many of the diseases to which flesh is heir.

    </li>
    <li id=2593 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Of all these there is not one which exerts so malificent an influence on the frame, as excessive discharge of the seminal fluid, whether it be poured forth in a healthy condition, or whether it be diseased, thin and watery, in consequence of the habitual practice of one of the most dangerous habits man can acquire.

    </li>
    <li id=2594 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Sexual intercourse if carried to excess, is markedly injurious; daily experience is confirmatory of the assertion, but the injury resulting from self-pollution so far exceeds it in magnitude, as scarcely to admit of a comparison between their respective consequences.

    </li>
    <li id=2595 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is therefore still more to be dreaded in its final action than sexual intercourse.

    </li>
    <li id=2596 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This fact admits of ready explanation.

    </li>
    <li id=2597 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Sexual intercourse, even when carried to such an extent as to be absolutely immoderate, cannot however be pursued without occasional periods of cessation,—lasting for a lapse of time far beyond that which occurs in the manipulations of the masturbator.

    </li>
    <li id=2598 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Repeated connexion with women cannot be carried out so frequently, as the man guilty of self-pollution can pursue his degrading and destructive practices, nor is it attended when it does take place, with the same amount of sexual and general excitement.

    </li>
    <li id=2599 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The nervous energy is consequently less depressed, and the powers of life rally sooner.

    </li>
    <li id=2600 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If then we take in account these several facts, that sexual intercourse is not repeated so frequently, nor so soon after the previous act, that it is not attended with the same amount of general excitement and consequently the nervous system is more rapidly restored, and less permanently injured, than by the act of onanism, the difference in their respective influences on the system will be readily understood and generally admitted.

    </li>
    <li id=2601 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From a knowledge of these facts, it appears evident, that those individuals who suffer themselves to be governed by passion rather than by reason, and whose vivid imagination leads them to the indulgence of censual habits earlier than Nature intended, anticipate the ability of manhood ere its empire is established; thus demolishing the delicate groundwork cf physical energy, and soliciting a manhood of disgraceful imbecility.

    </li>
    <li id=2602 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This maniacal act of delusion not only deprives the system of its salutary and essential support, but abo obstructs the power of seminal excitement; and, by stimulating the organs to transier.

    </li>
    <li id=2608 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      By the repeated excitement of the nervous system, produced by the practice of this unnatural and self-destroying passion, the constitution is left in a deplorable state of health, and that neivous condition kept up, which places the individual in a state of anxiety and misery for the remainder of his existence,—a kind of contingency, which it is difficult for language adequately to describe; he vegetates, but lives not: hence the consequences arising out of the ashes of this dangerous phoenix are not confined to its pure physical result, but extend to moral ones, leading the excited deviating mind into a fertile field of seductive error—into a gradual and fatal degradation of manhood—into a pernicious, disgraceful, and ultimately almost involuntary application of those inherent rights which nature wisely instituted for the preservation of her species.

    </li>
    <li id=2609 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When once the destructive practice is established, the barrier of intellectual control falls; for the mind, that changling of social cultivated man, by a singular adjunction, becomes not the corrector, but the exciter and co-operator in defiance of culture, moral feeling, moral obligation, and religious impressions: thus the man, who, at the advent of youth and genius was endowed with gaiety and sociality, becomes, ere twenty-five summers have shed their lustre on him, a misanthrope, and a nadirpoint of discontent!

      Is it nothing to light the gloomy torch that guides, by slow and melancholy steps to the sepulchre of manhood, in the gay and fascinating spring-time of youth and ardent desire; when the brilliant fire of passion, genius, and sentiment, ought to electrify the whole frame?

      To begin the career of manhood by the abuse of Nature&#39;s functions, and that too, when the system has not completed the powers of its organization, and abounds with energy and passion, is contrary to all the rules by which health and happiness may be attained; exclusively absorbed by this fatal passion, all the powers of mind and body are wasted in illusion, and an age of care and anxiety follows, ere the full period of manhood has been reached; as it keeps the individual in a state of perpetual effervescence, it becomes the worst of all delusions; and, under the varied forms of its peculiar excitement, it produces morbid sensibility, erotic imagination, and their consequent results—hypochondriasis hysteria, indigestion, &amp;c.

      That the dangerous consequences of those delusive acts are not early felt, does not prove they never will in the lapse of time: and if, in some iron constitutions, it does not produce any physical consequences, it still leaves upon the mind a painful impression, and causes doubt, anxiety, and a marked dissatisfaction with the conditions upon which the tenure of life is held: in fact, it has no counterbalancing advantage, no redeeming quality; it is equally injurious to physical and moral purity; and however modified by strength of constitution or of mind, ought not to be regarded with any thing approaching to indifference; it is a state too dangerous, indeed, to be regarded with indifference; and we hesitate not to say, that, in its mischievous progress, it is the herald of every baneful vice: and when the individual, overwhelmed with disgrace, contempt, and odium, can no longer sustain the excitement, the mind, revolting against an existence that assimilates to it nothing but unhappy aberrations, seeks peace from its errors in suicide: it gradually diminishes the sensibility of the organs; and generally produces emaciation, which ends either in tabes or atrophy, for sooner or later, it weakens the power of digestion: and the bile, the gastric and pancreatic juices, all become vitiated.

      In fact, this practice not only injures the body, but the mind also and that at a period when it is full of genius and power: even when the passions are developing themselves in the zenith and energy of their action, its influence is felt throughout the whole fabric, acting with fearful energy on the mental faculties, and rendering the individual unqualified for the ordinary and necessary avocations of social life: reducing him to a state of childish imbecility and premature decrepitude, and bringing on all the habitudes of premature age, ere the middle of life has arrived: he carries with him the form and aspect of other men, but without the vigour and energy of that season which his early youth bade him hope to attain.

      When tabes dorsalis has existed for a length of time in the constitution, the frequent and involuntary discharges of the semen, from ideas arising in the mind during sleep, or by unnatural practices, the seminal vesicles become so relaxed and weakened, that they have not sufficient power to retain it.

      Almost as fast as it is secreted from the blood, the slightest stimulus in the mind, from external objects, causes it to run off by its own reservoirs into the urethra; and in course of time the natural secretion of the gland through which the semen passes becomes &#39;vitiated, till at last these organs become merely a common cistern or sink to carry off involuntarily the most precious humour of the human body.

      By way of distinction from other consumptions, this disease is termed tabes dorsalis, because the seat of the disease at its commencement is generally perceived to affect the patient about the loins, and the small of his back, the seminal functions being the chief seat of the disorder.

    </li>
    <li id=2684 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the beginning of this disease the body is sometimes costive, with symptoms of heat in some parts, whilst others are cold, and a lowness of spirits with melancholy generally attend; but whether these are real symptoms or not, must be ascertained by the experienced practitioner.

      When it is taken early, and rightly understood, it is not dangerous; but when it has existed for a length of time, the constitution will decay, and, as we have frequently observed, it is attended with peculiar circumstances, which differ from other consumptions; for, when the patient has discovered the cause of his malady, he despairs of a cure, while if rightly managed and properly understood it is impossible he should miscarry.

      A pain, with weakness, sometimes seizes the small of the back, and now and then a troublesome sensation seems to descend, by the backbone, upon the loins; the patient by degrees will sometimes grow chilly, and any air colder than ordinary pierces the spine.

      Moving pains of the head will often take place, and wandering pains of the legs, arms, and joints, accompanied sometimes with a weakness of all the senses, whereupon all sensation becomes vitiated; the eyes suffer from clouds and mists that seem to fall before the sight and intercept the light; and the ears sometimes sing and tingle, as if something were breeding in their hollow cavities.

      Upon an involuntary emission of the semen, which will sometimes be frequent under this decay, the strength of the patient seems to come away with it; and there have been instances of bis lying like a log, unable

      An eloquent writer also remarks, that &quot;all the intellectual functions participate in this derangement: the memory loses its retentive power; the ideas are connected with no solidity: caprice rather than reflection governs every action, and, in fact, partial insanity invades the whole system; while inward terror, restlessness, and constant anguish, are never absent from the hapless sufferer, if this state of system be long allowed to predominate.&quot;

      Such individuals generally become hypocondriacal or hysterical, with all the ills attendant on these tedious complaints: some are affected with coughs, slow fevers, and lingering consumptions: the most acute pains pervade different parts of the body; which frequently have been referred to imaginary sensibility, but which sensations, we contend, are actually present, and produce a change of organization equally as hostile to the mind as to the constitution, and which are called into action on the slightest impression.

      There are not only to be seen pimples on the face, which is a common symptom, but even blotches and carbuncles sometimes appear there, as well as on the nose, breast and thighs: and occasionally, fleshy excrescences arise on the forehead.

    <li id=2701 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Amid this mighty ravage of silent disease, the generative organs are also affected: the semen is evacuated on the slightest irritation, even on going to stool: numbers are affected with habitual gonorrhoea, which entirely destroys the energy and vigour of the constitution, the discharge assuming the appearance of that which flows from old ulcers in the legs: impotence more or less exists: the functions of the intestines are sometimes totally destroyed; and some individuals complain of costiveness, others of diarrhaea and piles, thus constituting a class of disease, calamitous indeed, which perhaps, at its first approach may arise without producing any organic alteration, but ultimately assists in nourishing those changes that become combined with the affections produced.

      We are of opinion that they not only occasion impotence in the one sex, and sterility in the other, but that they lay the foundation of those tedious discharges which sometimes assume the character of seminal, and at other times of mucal, gleets.

    <li id=2703 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The Arabian physicians, who were the first to practise the art of healing, have handed down to us, in their writings, the reasons why a discharge of semen will weaken the body more than the loss of a large quantity of blood.

    </li>
    <li id=2704 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There have also been some of the moderns who have calculated how much the body is weakened by a seminal emission; but all this seems to arise from a kind of epilepsy, or convulsion, which accompanies the emission, especially in the unnatural way, and not from the quantity of semen lost, provided the nerves are in a healthy state; for, if the individual be in sound health, his strength returns in a little time, even before a fresh supply of semen itfelf can be restored, providing the discharge of the seminal fluid be effected in the way nature has pointed out, and not in the manner which these pages are intended to reprobate in the strongest terms our language enables us to adopt.

    </li>
    <li id=2705 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A learned physician who wrote about thirty years since, in describing the wretched condition of those who have impaired their health and capabilities by masturbation, observes, &quot;Like every other organ of the body, the seminal vessels have a certain round of action to perform, which, if undisturbed, they will continue to do through a whole course of long life.

    </li>
    <li id=2706 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These actions will proceed with considerable regularity, even where sexual intercourse is altogether neglected; for the healthy secretion of semen, when it has proceeded to a certain extent, will naturally be thrown off without occasioning disease: but, like every other organ of the body, when subjected to continued extraordinary exertion, from whatever cause, their action is altered; they become diseased, and either cease to secrete healthy semen, become incapable of retaining it after it is secreted, or are entirely and irrecoverably rendered unfit for again resuming their office.

    </li>
    <li id=2707 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This irrecoverable state, however, is much less common than was once supposed.

    </li>
    <li id=2708 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The disease is most frequently caused by habits altogether contrary to the laws of nature, and to habituate ourselves to such practices, by working up the imagination, and creating artificial desires, is always injurious; and the more delicate the vessels exposed to such practices, the more likely they are to be seriously injured.

    </li>
    <li id=2709 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This observation is strictly applicable to the present complaint.

    </li>
    <li id=2710 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Indeed, from the commencement of the unfortunate habit of self-pollution, which is the most frequent cause of this disease, there is seldom any desire for sexual intercourse; and although such desire should be felt, a repetition of these unmanly habits is preferred to natural connection.

    </li>
    <li id=2711 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      At length there is induced a great derangement in the digestive organs—a general lassitude, with a weariness, often approaching to pain, in the loins—the bowels become constipated, often in an alarming degree—the face pale, bloated, and cadaverous, and the body is generally flabby or emaciated, with coldness in the extremities.

    </li>
    <li id=2712 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Then occur trembling hands, dim eyes, confused ringing in the ears, indistinct hearing, if not entire deafness, accompanied with frequent and violent head-ache.

    </li>
    <li id=2713 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Drowsiness also exists, without the power to sleep, all attempts at which are interrupted by the most frightful dreams.

    </li>
    <li id=2714 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Indeed the individual becomes terrified to go to bed, lest sudden death should be his fate; and, during the day, he is timid, fretful, terrified, and discontented; has violent palpitations of the heart, and, though he seems sensible of the cause of his distress, is unable to abandon his habits, particularly while in bed.

    </li>
    <li id=2715 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Under such a state we often find instances of young men, who become delicate, without being affected with any particular complaint, and who are unhappy, but know not the cause.

    <li id=2716 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They become effeminate—a complete state of imbecility, both of body and mind at length ensues, and, in some, the haggard countenance but imperfectly proclaims the distraction of the mind.

      general depravity, and these its consequences, at length terminate the existence of thousands, who are supposed to die from very different causes.

    </li>
    <li id=2719 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This is a general sketch of these symptoms; but we must examine them more particularly.

    </li>
    <li id=2720 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Young men, of a good natural constitution, enter upon that thoughtless part of their lives, and very often by the advice and example of their schoolfellows, commence improper practices, heedless of what is to be the dreadful result to a very great majority of them.

    </li>
    <li id=2721 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If they reason at all, they calculate, that they will escape, however much others may have suffered, and they thus proceed upon plans, which are, in their own way of reasoning, of a stable nature.

    </li>
    <li id=2722 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A ruined constitution is the consequence, and then they can give an advice which is also disregarded by others till too late.

    </li>
    <li id=2723 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Such improper practices, sooner or later, according to the original vigour of constitution, subject the individual to a train of the most awful sufferings.

    </li>
    <li id=2724 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      One may be affected in a few months, another not perhaps for a year or two, but none entirely escape; they all at length precipitate themselves into an abyss which we should fail in attempting to describe.

    <li id=2725 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In some whose organs have arrived at that state of derangement which gives origin to such a complaint, the emission during connection is performed very variously.

    </li>
    <li id=2726 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the early stages, the emission is sometimes scarcely to be obtained, at least for a very great length of time: while in others, particularly in the advanced stages, the emission occurs inconceivably soon; indeed, some cannot at all perform the act of copulation before it has taken place; while others, from the particular morbid condition of the testicles, during which no secretion takes place, have no emission at all.

    </li>
    <li id=2727 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It has also frequently been observed that different persons were in some respects affected very differently.

    </li>
    <li id=2728 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Certain wanderings of the imagination, for instance, during sleep, cause erections—the secretion of semen goes on—the relaxed seminal vessels are unable to retain it, and, by the very slightest occasional cause, an emission takes place.

    </li>
    <li id=2729 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In some also, very gentle friction, such as is caused by moderate horse-back exercise, or by their clothes while walking, &amp;c.

    </li>
    <li id=2730 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      or even an attempt to perform sexual intercourse, is instantly followed by an emission; while others, although during their dreams, they had from one to five or six emissions in one night, could use any kind of ordinary exercise without causing an effect of this kind; and whose various attempts, perhaps in the same night, to effect such an evacuation in the natural way, were quite ineffectual, even although the scene of action was often protracted, and the attempt stili persevered in for an incredible length of time.

    </li>
    <li id=2731 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Although these are the most common periods of the disease for such unpleasant occurrences to take place, yet this is often reversed.

    </li>
    <li id=2732 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This is one of the many proofs of the impossibility of applying general rules, too often had recourse to in considering diseases and their treatment, and not more particularly attending to the individual peculiarities which, often, in the most unaccountable manner, are to be found in the world.

    </li>
    <li id=2733 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Thus while some propel the semen vigorously, even in advanced stages of the complaint, in others it comes off almost without the sufferer being aware of it.

    </li>
    <li id=2734 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Fleshy excrescences, and even abscesses sometimes break out about the anus, and at the same time there is often also felt a degree of irritation or itching about that part of the urethra where the seminal vessels open into it, which is generally attributed to the presence of strictures, to a disease of the bladder, or of the pros





tate gland; when they are merely the consequence of diseased action in the seminal vessels themselves, and are removeable by whatever restores them to their healthy condition.

    </li>
    <li id=2735 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In more advanced stages there is often felt a stinging pain, occasionally darting along the spermatic chord, and also an almost perpetual seemingly rotatory motion felt in the testicle itself, causing a very great degree of uneasiness to the unfortunate patient.

    </li>
    <li id=2736 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The scrotum is in general lax, and the testicles, (one frequently more than another,) hang down much lower than is natural, and there is often a pain, or certain sensation, experienced in them of the most distressing nature.

    </li>
    <li id=2737 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The external parts of generation also, in common with the rest of the body, suffer considerably.

    </li>
    <li id=2738 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The penis is shrivelled, and there is often discharged from the urethra, a sort of thinner fluid than semen, especially while at stool.

    </li>
    <li id=2739 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We shall find this shrinking of the penis a very frequent occurrence in these cases, because it is closely connected with the existing state of the seminal vessels.

    </li>
    <li id=2740 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Thus, in castrated animals, the parts forming the penis shrink in a wonderful degree.

    </li>
    <li id=2741 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Indeed, many instances have been observed where the penis, although formerly of a full size, had become so small that it could scarcely be seized between the finger and thumb, and, on the seminal vessels being restored to health, the penis again resumed its former size.

    </li>
    <li id=2742 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Some individuals are incapable of the slightest erection, while others have the most painful erections every night, while in bed: often altogether unaccompanied by any desire for sexual intercourse.

    </li>
    <li id=2743 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These not only prevent the due refreshment from sleep, but before morning, reduce the parts to a disagreeable state of painful feeling, from which they scarcely recover before the following night, when, from the same cause, they relapse into their former state.

    </li>
    <li id=2744 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Indeed such sleep as is obtained, yields no sort of comfort or refreshment, for the individual almost always feels languid and oppressed, even on getting out of bed; and there is an occasional sort of burning hectic, alternated by a sensation of cold running down the back, towards the loins, which continues to wear away his strength.

    </li>
    <li id=2745 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The most dreadful effect of this disease, even, where the mind is still alive to the extent of the patient&#39;s own wretchedness, is certainly where a sort of indescribably painful twitching is felt in some parts during the intervals, and a convulsion of the whole body is experienced immediately after each emission.

    </li>
    <li id=2746 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He is even sensible of, and yet is unable to put a stop to it; the body is drenched in cold sweat, he is oppressed with a most distressing faintness, and total imbecility to move the position of his body, and the extremities often, for hours after, lose in a great measure, their sense of feeling.

    </li>
    <li id=2747 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Such is the alteration which this disease produces, particularly in inveterate cases, that its victims become totally different in every respect, both bodily and mental, from what they formerly were.

    </li>
    <li id=2748 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The body is reduced from the utmost state of strength to the greatest possible degree of debility; in some it is bloated, in others haggard; but in both there is a paleness accompanied by blue blotches on the face, and often ulcers on the body, which, added to their horror of mind, even as depicted in their countenance, far exceeds the power of description.

    </li>
    <li id=2749 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is scarcely to be credited, except by those who have frequent opportunities of witnessing it, what an astonishing effect this morbid state of the seminal vessels has on every faculty of the mind as well as on the body.

      While the bodily form fails,—while the eyes sink in their sockets, and the vision is languid and indistinct—while he is susceptible of cold and easily affected by changes of the weather, the senses also partake of the general wreck, and are either altogether depraved, vitiated, or destroyed.

    </li>
    <li id=2751 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The memory generally fails first—then the sight, the hearing, and every faculty of the judgment are gradually, all, less or more, impaired, till the sufferer is reduced to an almost complete state of idiocy.

      Thus unfortunately situated, he is perpetually overpowered by the most painful and dreadful melancholy gloom; he takes no delight in the society even of his greatest friends; and in constant anguish and remorse, with perpetual restlessness, often sheds tears at the recollection of his wretched situation —he pines in solitary and unavailing misery—none know his distresses, and none can pity him.

      He even loves to brood over his misfortunes; magnifies them, if possible; is perpetually miserable, both awake and in his dreams; he is gloomy, morose, and suspicious that every person is laying plans for his destruction; his feelings are indescribable, and he is in perpetual terror, he knows not for what.

      It is preceded in some instances by loss of appetite, in others quite the contrary, but although the sufferer may eat moderately or even voraciously, digestion is not performed in a healthy manner, so as to afford the proper degree of nourishment and support to the system; but instead thereof the food when in the stomach is changed by the putrefactive fermentation, and foul and putrid eructations, with excessive flatulence arise therefrom, and severely influence the brain, causing the most extraordinary feelings in that organ, such as no pen can faithfully describe.

      In addition to this, the unfortunate patient is frequently troubled with a short dry cough, hoarseness, occasional attacks of sore throat, weakness of the voice, an unpleasant expectoration, pains about the chest, fetidity of the breath, and many other symptoms indicative of the disorder affecting the nerves supplying the chest and its contents, and the parts of the system which are connected therewith.

      This disease, though perhaps one of the most afflicting to the human mind, is that which draws the least compassion from friends; no heart seems sensible of their distress, no soul is touched with their sufferings, because the- distemper does not immediately destroy those whom it attacks: as if death were the greatest evil, and most to be avoided by human nature; yet, perhaps, in this instance, that we cannot die become* the greatest calamity, and makes the most afflicting circumstance of the situation in which the sufferer is unfortunately placed.

      To describe every symptom of this disease, is to paint almost all others which attend the long train of sickness, so various is it in its appearance; yet, by strictly examining all, and attending to those symptoms, which are the never-failing companions of this disorder, we may trace it back to its primary cause; and thus settle a proper method of treating it, and perhaps effectuate a cure by going directly to its origin.

      This, it appears to us, may be obtained in this instance, and without much difficulty, where the practitioner has a good share of experience: not unfrequently, the abuse of the functions of generation are the preceding causes, destroying the appetite and lessening the vital heat, thus producing the very same symptoms that follow the other forms of disease arising from the same cause.

      The symptoms then, as they are generally found in various persons, under the inauspicious influence of this malady, are nearly related to those affections of the human frame which have been previously mentioned, and are as follow;





Not unfrequently spasms, like those attending epileptic fits, a grievous head-ache, confined to a very small spot of the head, palpitations of the heart, sometimes a dry cough, those complaints resembling the iliac passion giving the countenance a sallow tinge, like the jaundice; also complaints exactly resembling the gravel.

      The legs sometimes swell, but are distinguished from the hydropic, by their not pitting, and by the swelling being greater in the morning; a sensation of cold in all the external parts, when the patient is attacked periodically; this symptom generally begins the paroxysm, and continues while it lasts; the urine is sometimes limpid, and in large quantity, at other times the contrary, with sometimes a chalky farinaceous and pink-coloured sediment; foetid or sour eructations from the stomach, and a rising in the throat; frequently a low pulse, sometimes a cadaverous aspect, great dejection of spirits, and internal sinkings; at other times tears, without any cause to provoke them; the soul appearing to be sick rather than the body, cherishing as it were the idea of its own sufferings.

      He entered, says this celebrated physician, upon marriage, at an advanced age, with a view to get an heir to his estates and honours; and at the time he was endeavouring to consummate his nuptials, he was





seized with a violent suffocation, which obliged him to discontinue.

      The weakness which follows the act has appeared to several persons, and not without reason, as a proof that it could not be solely the privation of semen which occasioned it: but what demonstrably proves how much the spasms must weaken the human frame, is the feeble state of many of the patients who have fallen under our care, at various periods in life, labouring under maladies arising therefrom: we have seen some affected as if epilepsy had attacked them.

      Samuel Verspretius,&quot; he says, &quot;applied to him for advice; his complaint was, a flux of seminal matter which flowed from him at all times, but particularly when at stool, and in the company of women, without having the powers of manhood; in length of time it became sharp and acrimonious, attended with great pain.

      After this, a scorbutic eruption broke out on the hind part of his head and the nape of his neck;,





thence it extended to the spinal marrow, the loins, the buttocks, and the articulation of the thigh, which made this unfortunate man suffer such excruciating pains, that his countenance was distorted, and he was seized with a slow fever, which by degrees consumed him, but not so fast as he desired; and he was in such a situation, that he frequently invoked death, before it snatched him from his misery.&quot;

      As has been already stated, all the important viscera of the body are involved in the complication of symptoms which characterise the indulgence either of the sexual passion in great excess, or of the still worse and still more destructive habit of masturbation.

      As a matter of course the heart, the central organ of circulation, which in every respect must evidently be greatly excited in all the acts of generation, could not escape.

      bear in mind the hurried breathing and the powerful action of the heart, we cannot be surprised that its repeated excitement during the act of manustupration, practised so frequently as it generally is, should tend to induce serious derangement of the function, and to cause palpitations, which if not constant, are easily brought on by the slightest cause.

    </li>
    <li id=2802 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Another and very efficient reason may also be alleged for the disordered action of the heart under the circumstances to which we have alluded, and that is the enormous expenditure of the nervous fluid which necessarily takes place, as a consequence of the act we have so often characterised as dangerous and unmanly in the extreme.

    <li id=2803 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Physiologists have long been doubtful whether the animal spirit and the nervous fluid are the same; but observation teaches us that those two fluids if not identical, have a very strict analogy, and the loss of the one or of the other produces similar evils to the constitution.

      The eyelids become affected with a chronic kind of inflammation, and secrete a watery fluid during the day, which at night-time becomes thick and inspissated, so that the eyelids, those coverings and protectors of the organs of vision, become adherent together, and cannot be separated without trouble and difficulty.

    </li>
    <li id=2806 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The eyes themselves also are engaged in the general mischief—the sight becomes dim, a veil as it were hangs over the organs, impeding their utility, and rendering it impossible to keep them occupied in examining one object continuously for a certain length of time.

    </li>
    <li id=2807 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If not previously in that condition, the unhappy victim of so much misery speedily becomes short-sighted, or myopic; dark spots float before the eyes; flashes and corruscations of fight are seen impinging on the nerves of vision, which become so sensibly weakened, as to render it almost impossible to use the organs in any ordinary avocation after daylight, while the bright light so divinely shed on the earth by that glorious luminary, the sun, becomes painful and annoying to eyes, weakened in their nervous energy by the exhausting drain to which the system has been so long subjected.

      This young man, having given way to this practice, at the age of fifteen, till he was three and twenty, was at that period seized with such a weakness in his head and eyes, that the latter were frequently affected with violent spasms at the time of his seminal emissions.

      An idea may be formed of the importance of the seminal liquor, by observing the effects it produces as soon as it begins to be formed; the voice, the physiognomy, and features of the face change; the beard grows, and the whole body often takes another appearance, because the muscles acquire a firmness and power, forming a sensible difference between the body of an adult person and that of a youth not yet arrived at the age of puberty; these changes are prevented by destroying that organ which serves to separate the liquor that produces it ;.

      This generalising plan, or total neglect, sometimes on the part of the patient, sometimes on the part of the surgeon, and sometimes on the part of both, and even injudicious treatment, which must solely be owing to the medical attendant, have often reduced a once healthy and robust constitution to the greatest possible degree of lingering misery.

      The various effects that urethral discharges have upon the animal frame, depend greatly on the influence they exert on the mind: in some, nocturnal emissions lay the foundation of seminal weakness and gleet, and cases occur where the system having long laboured under the influence of nocturnal emissions, feels more powerfully than it would under other circumstances the nervous irritation which usually accompanies a profuse discharge of the semen; proving beyond doubt, the existence of chronic debility; for that which has little effect on one constitution, will produce in others symptoms extremely harassing both to the body and mind; and thus a complex derangement arises, the combined result of a concatenation of events that may be traced, even with mathematical precision, to the debilitating cause: fcr we are led to infer that seminal weakness precedes this nervous derangement: and to us it is evident, that when nervous debility exists, the nocturnal emissions are increased; the repetition of them unquestionably weakens the vital energy, and after an indefinite period, predisposes the cerebral organs to morbid irritation.

    </li>
    <li id=2959 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Thus from sympathy with the nerves, the general system becomes disturbed, and the body and mind are rendered susceptible to the caprice of that vicissitude of irritation whose universality of influence can only be described by those who have felt its energy: nor is the effect of this influence the offspring of a fervid or depressed imagination: on the contrary, a class of painful and distressing diseases is originated, which, in their progress, have a great effect on the organization.

    </li>
    <li id=2960 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This morbid irritability more frequently attends on constitutions previously debilitated by venereal excess, or, more frequently still, by the baneful habit of onanism, by which the parts are not





only so weakened, but are also rendered so irritable, and from habit, so easily excited by mental influences, that the slightest stimulus is sufficient to call them into action, and thereby produce a discharge of vitiated semen.

    <li id=2961 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This disease arises from a spontaneous erection of the penis, often imperfect, and a discharge of semen unsolicited by the patient, who frequently is unconscious of it till awakened by the act of emission: this is caused either by the distended and congested state of the vessels, or is the consequence of lascivious dreams inspired by the general unhealthy tone and excited condition of the brain and the other organs connected with the function of generation.

    </li>
    <li id=2962 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Of this act men are mostly unconscious; if however it arrests attention, its frequency and its consequences are the circumstances that rouse the proper and natural fears of the sufferer.

      Our ample experience warrants the conclusion that the debility is more obviously confirmed, and absolute impotence more certainly follows in those instances where emissions occur pretty frequently, the sufferer waking suddenly in the night, at the moment of the discharge.

      One of the most frequent, however, is the existence of the malady called leucorrhea, or whites.

    </li>
    <li id=3040 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Barrenness is also very often caused by a retention, irregularity, or profusion of the menstrual secretion, thereby giving rise to the diseases known by the names of chlorosis, or green sickness, amenorrhoea, or obstructed menstruation, dysmenorrhea or painful and scanty menstruation, and monorrhagia, or excessive menstruation and flooding.

    </li>
    <li id=3041 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It may also proceed from a natural frigidity of temperament or from aversion, reserve or indifference, instead of an appetency and pleasure; in short from an irrespondence in the feelings of the female to those of the male.

      And when it is accompanied by sterility on the part of the female, what reproaches, and even disgust does it not give rise tP,—converting love to hatred,—making the nuptial couch a bed of thorns, instead of roses,—marriage a curse rather than a blessing.

    </li>
    <li id=3046 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We are, indeed, aware, that by many men of high attainment in the less enlightened period of medical information, relief has been deemed impracticable.

    </li>
    <li id=3047 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But we are also perfectly aware of the possibility of a cure in all these cases; and that even where the disease of sterility appears to have taken the firmest hold of the female constitution, assistance can be given to the suffering patient, not through the application of transitory stimulants, to the destruction of all constitutional vigour and ultimately of life; nor yet by speculative remedies, which, by changing the symptoms and appearance of disease, may induce hope, and Jead to ardent expectations—only to destroy them in the end.

      From the very character and construction of the female organs, there are peculiar crises in their lives when every solicitude is attracted to them.

      It is usually known as the turn of life, and takes place from about the 40th to the 45th year; though it is sometimes delayed longer.

    </li>
    <li id=3054 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The diseases that spring up at this time are numerous and formidable ;, and it behoves all women undergoing the change in question, to reflect seriously on their situation.

    </li>
    <li id=3055 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Let them not suppose, that because many have passed through the turn of life with little difficulty, it is therefore to be neglected; for, though a safe conduct through it is ensured by the use of the Cordial Balm Of Syriacum, yet such is the fatal effect of negleet, that we are assured more women ares carried off during the period when the cessation of tbe menses takes place, than at any other period of life.

    </li>
    <li id=3056 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      At the time this fluctuating change is going on, the constitution should be most carefully regulated, for the menstrual vessels do not suddenly surrender their secretive powers, but usually a distressing irregularity torments the patient, attended with internal pains, sometimes actual enlargement of the womb, which may be mistaken for pregnancy, &amp;c.

      Some are afflicted with the well-known symptoms of plethora, heat, flushings, restless nights, troublesome dreams, and unequal spirits; others are attacked with spasmodic affections, stiffness of the limbs, swelled ancles, piles, and other indications of plenitude.

      Women, however, must be sensible of the peculiar influence this secretion has upon their frame, and we have only strenuously to advise them, as soon as any symptoms of constitutional derangement shall begin to display themselves, to commence a course of the Cordial Balm Op Syriacum, which must be taken according to the general directions.

To be observed by those labouring under Generative Debility, Seminal Weakness, Impotence, Nocturnal Emissions, or Deficiency of Natural Strength, while under a course of the Cordial Balm Of Syriacum.

    <li id=3118 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      ADVICE AND PLAIN RULES FOR PATIENTS.

    </li>
    <li id=3119 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The first step that should be taken with regard to the cure, is, to leave off those practices that have occasioned the disease,—though it may appear to be a difficult matter, as the very soul itself is generally so much polluted that it can dwell on no other idea.

    </li>
    <li id=3120 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      However by a sincere repentance, and fixed determination to desist before it is too late, there is not the least doubt but that the irritability and tendency to excitement may be subdued, provided the following rules be attended to.

    </li>
    <li id=3121 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Although the efficacy of the Cordial Balm Of Syriacum is such, that in most cases no assistance is required from any thing else, yet a due attention to air, exercise, sleep, and regimen, is in all cases proper, and in some absolutely necessary.

    </li>
    <li id=3122 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A few words on each of these heads will be sufficient.

    </li>
    <li id=3123 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Wherever the patient is, he must not neglect exercise; it should be moderate at first and augmented by degrees, being always left off before a feeling of great fatigue is experienced.

    </li>
    <li id=3124 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      All exercise is best fasting, and with regard to the kind of exercise most conducive to health, none is preferable to walking.

    </li>
    <li id=3125 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Violent or long-continued exercise of mind or body, impairs the muscular strength, on account, it is presumed, of the dissipation of the subtle enlivening fluid.

    </li>
    <li id=3126 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In fact excess of all kinds is certain to be injurious.

    </li>
    <li id=3127 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Much depends on a due regulation of sleep, especially as the want or disturbance of that great restorative is one of the most distressing symptoms of the disease.

    </li>
    <li id=3128 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To contribute effectually to the cure, it should be sound and not too long; the best way of procuring sleep is .

    </li>
    <li id=3129 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      upon a hard bed or mattress; rising early, taking sufficient exercise and proper food during the day, and supping lightly.

    </li>
    <li id=3130 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The greatest attention should be paid by the patient both to the quantity and quality of his food: he should rather eat a little and often, than gorge himself with a full meal at any one time.

    </li>
    <li id=3131 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This rule is the more necessary as a preternatural voracity of appetite is a frequent symptom in this and every other species of decay.

    </li>
    <li id=3132 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Animal food should be taken once a day.

    </li>
    <li id=3133 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Hot and heavy suppers are very injurious in every way.

    </li>
    <li id=3134 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They not only tend greatly to disturb and disorder the functions of the stomach, which in this complaint are rendered preternaturally weak, but they also have a great tendency to increase that irritability which renders the sleep broken and unrefreshing.

    </li>
    <li id=3135 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Roots, as potatoes, parsnips, carrots, &amp;c.

    </li>
    <li id=3136 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      , afford much nourishment: and, at dinner and supper, drink good pure water, discoloured with a little wine, or else very good table beer, &amp;c.

    </li>
    <li id=3137 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Spirituous liquors in any form are very injurious, as are also some malt liquors.

    </li>
    <li id=3138 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From two to three glasses of port wine or claret may be taken, especially after or during dinner.

    </li>
    <li id=3139 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      For weakness, deficiency of natural strength, and relaxation of the vessels, by too frequent indulgence of the passions, the Cordial Balm Of Syriacum with the Purifying Specific Pills, constitutes a safe, certain, and invaluable remedy; and if, during the time the patient is under a course of these medicines, he were to accustom himself to the use of sponging the whole body with cold water, every morning on first getting out of bed, it would be highly beneficial: it should be done quickly, and followed with a rough towel.

    </li>
    <li id=3140 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It has considerable effect in giving tone to the skin, and maintaining a proper action in it, and thus proves a safeguard to the injurious influence of cold and sudden changes of temperature; therefore, a person who is in the habit of thus fortifying the skin, will be much less likely to suffer injury from heated rooms, and the change from a hot room to the cold air.

    </li>
    <li id=3141 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It also exerts a peculiar influence on the skin itself, which in the numerous and exhausting complaints dependant on onanism or their causes, becomes rough and dry, the pores of the skin being in an unhealthy and unnatural state, in common with the other excretory organs of the body.

    </li>
    <li id=3142 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The cold bath recommends itself in a variety of cases; and is particulary beneficial to the inhabitants of populous cities, who indulge in voluptuousness, or lead sedentary lives.

    </li>
    <li id=3143 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In persons of this description the action of the solids is always too&#39; weak, which induces a languid circulation, a crude indigested mass of humours, and obstruction in the capillary vessels and glandular system.

    </li>
    <li id=3144 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Cold water, from its gravity, as well as its tonic power, is well calculated either to obviate or remove these symptoms.

    </li>
    <li id=3145 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It accelerates the motion of the blood, promotes the different secretions, and gives permanent vigour to the solids.

      These important purposes are always most essentially answered by sea-bathing; salt water ought to be preferred, not only on account of its superior gravity, but likewise for its greater power of stimulating the skin, which promotes the perspiration, and prevents the patient from catching cold.

      GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE

VENEREAL DISEASE.

    </li>
    <li id=3192 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The nature of a specific contagion, whence originates the disease we are now treating upon, and which has the property of inducing, in the individual who suffers from it, a secretion possessing the same characters and capable of reproducing the disease in others, presents to us on all sides, a variety of difficulties, springing principally from the various shapes it assumes, according to the constitution of the patient, the malignity and virulence of the poison, its duration, and many other, perhaps occult, causes.

    </li>
    <li id=3193 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We know that it arises from the absorption of a specific morbid poison, generally imbibed during the act of coition with a person actually infected; and that thus produced, it is capable of assuming that variety of forms which it exhibits in different constitutions, and which, depending on the nature of the virus, and the nature of the constitution by which that virus is received, gives rise to that multiplicity of symptoms, which, in some constitutions are slight and in others malignant.

    </li>
    <li id=3194 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This pre-disposition to contagion is powerfully manifested in some persons, while in others the power of repulsion or an inaptitude to its imbibition is equally exhibited.

    </li>
    <li id=3195 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      How frequently do we find, that one individual shall transgress with a female labouring under the venereal disease, yet no symptoms or evidence of infection follow; while another less fortunate, under similar circumstances, and perhaps even with the same female, will have the disease shew itself in its most virulent features; in short it is an indisputable fact, that every venereal case, is a case sui generis, for in no class of disease do we meet with cases less similar to each other, either in regard to the period the disease takes to develop its action, or the characters it may display; these contrarieties appear to be greatly influenced by the existing state of the individual system at the moment of contagion: a knowledge of these facts, however, points out the necessity of the adoption of an early and unequivocal line of conduct in the first stage of our fears, so that we may not afterwards have occasion to regret that the absence of more decided symptoms betrayed us into an indifference which may lead, and has not unfrequently led, to future embarrasment and considerable personal annoyance.

    </li>
    <li id=3196 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We would wish earnestly to impress on the mind of the patient, that during the early days of infection, the disease is generally easy of eradication.

    </li>
    <li id=3197 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This disease may be introduced into the system either in the natural and most common way, through the medium of absorbent vessels, or by transplanting a tooth of one venereally affected, into a sound person.

    </li>
    <li id=3198 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It has also been not unfrequently conveyed by the touch alone, especially if the finger which is brought into close proximity with the diseased part





should happen to have an agnail, a chap, fissure, or broken place or wound of any kind.

    </li>
    <li id=3199 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The poison of syphilis may and has been conveyed also by inoculation, as is or rather has been practised with the small pox.

    </li>
    <li id=3200 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The diseases which it causes may be transmitted to the offspring, and by the child communicated to the healthy nurse by whom it is suckled.

    </li>
    <li id=3201 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The poison has even been conveyed into the system by means of leech bites.

    </li>
    <li id=3202 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the first, it is necessary that the virus should pass through the absorbent vessels into the blood, while in the latter, the absorbent vessels are less necessary to the virus being conveyed into the circulation, although they still have a great influence in the transmission of the disease.

    </li>
    <li id=3203 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the former, the disease is generally comparatively slow in its progress, in the latter it is rapid and violent.

    </li>
    <li id=3204 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The infecting matter cannot act through the medium of the air, but only through the medium of a fluid, as it cannot be communicated, except by the immediate contact of a sound with a diseased, person.

    </li>
    <li id=3205 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      And although, for the most evident reasons, it commonly appears on the genitals, particularly on the delicate surface of the glans penis, &amp;c.

    </li>
    <li id=3206 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      , the same virus is capable of occasioning morbid appearances on any other part or organ of the body.

    </li>
    <li id=3207 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Both sexes are equally exposed to venereal infection, but from the different structure of the parts, the symptoms in the female are scarcely ever so violent as in the male.

    </li>
    <li id=3208 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This has been attributed to the simplicity of structure of the female organs of generation, but we are of opinion, that it arises more commonly either from the natural or from the morbid flow of fluids to those parts washing off the infected matter, and also perhaps from greater local cleanliness.

    </li>
    <li id=3209 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When infection takes place, the poison is conveyed into the system by the lymphatic or absorbent vessels.

    </li>
    <li id=3210 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is in consequence of their dispersion over the whole body, that the virus may be absorbed on any part to which it is applied, and, by means of their infinite connections, it may be diffused, often with extraordinary rapidity through the whole system.

    </li>
    <li id=3211 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The poison is absorbed more or less quickly, according to the structure of the part to which it is applied, and the existing peculiarities of the constitution, health, &amp;c, of the person exposed to its effects.

    </li>
    <li id=3212 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If, for instance, from the same connexion, virus be lodged on any of the parts beneath the prepuce, and upon the external skin of the penis, and if such virus act effectually on both of these parts, there will be a distance of many days between the appearance of the disease in those parts respectively; the virus lodged beneath the prepuce acting before that upon the external skin on account of its being so much thinner, more delicate, and more vascular than the common integument.

    </li>
    <li id=3213 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Like every other infectious quality causing disease, the venereal poison undoubtedly possesses greater virulence at one time than at another, and even, in certain intervals, may be almost quiescent, though not entirely impaired, in its powers.

    </li>
    <li id=3214 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There can be no doubt, that the same circumstances attend every contagious disease.

    </li>
    <li id=3215 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The infection when it has been received in the usual way, within a certain time produces small ulcers, termed chancres, and afterwards, by irritating and inflaming the inguinal glands, when conveyed by the absorbents in its passage through them to the system, produces bubo in the groin.

    </li>
    <li id=3216 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From external appearances, such as chancre, bubo, or other affections of different parts, we are usually guided in our opinions respecting the existence of this disease, yet the system may sometimes be affected by it, independently of the occurrence of either of these symptoms.

    </li>
    <li id=3217 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In such cases, the glands of the groin are frequently more or less enlarged.

    </li>
    <li id=3218 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      By this single mark when we have no other leading symptoms, we may, in general, ascertain whether or not the patient be really affected with lues venerea, yet, it may often occur without previously producing either chancres, enlargement of these glands, or any other external sign of disease, though afterwards, blotches on the skin, ulcers on the tonsils, &amp;c, will convince us of its actual existence in the system as a secondary disease.

    </li>
    <li id=3219 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Though less commonly, sensations somewhat similar to rheumatism and not unfrequently mistaken by patients for ordinary rheumatic wandering pains, affect different parts, which at length settle in one or other of the bones either of the skull or face, or else in the long bones as they are termed, generally the shin bone or clavicle.

    </li>
    <li id=3220 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These are the most common secondary symptoms, although many others occur in practice, and are to be found described by writers on this disease.

    </li>
    <li id=3221 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These, however, we decline enumerating, as we wish principally to confine ourselves to the more common and more important occurrences.

    </li>
    <li id=3222 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The order, then, in which the venereal symptoms generally appear, after the virus has been absorbed, and before it has been checked, is, first, in the form of chancre, next, bubo, then eruptions, or ulcers on the skin, ulcers in the throat, peculiar inflammatory affections of the eye, and affections of the bones.

    </li>
    <li id=3223 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The first two symptoms are not so apt to vary in the order of their appearance as the others, which, with the affections of the bones (which are almost always experienced last, or at least in them the pains are last felt) are extremely different in different individuals, both in regard to time and severity.

    </li>
    <li id=3224 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Thus, however circumscribed the first appearance of this disease may be, unless arrested in its progress, it gradually proceeds to affect other parts of the body, until at length it completely contaminates the whole living system, and finally may even terminate existence, having previously reduced the whole body to a complete mass of ulceration and almost of putridity.

    </li>
    <li id=3225 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Perhaps there is no condition to which human nature is capable of being reduced, which renders it a more horrible spectacle, than the accumulated evils of confirmed pox.

    </li>
    <li id=3226 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We often have the misfortune to see the once manly and elegant form reduced to a complete mass of deformity.

    </li>
    <li id=3227 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The eyes being tender, one or both squinting and considerably protruded from their sockets, vision being also more or less imperfect—the nose flat, and the nostrils discharging foetid matter in considerable profusion—the gums consumed—the teeth rotten—the sockets exfoliating—the breath horribly foetid and disgusting—the neck stiff—the joints either large and decrepid, or absolutely rigid, and totally unfit for their common offices—ulcers of the very worst kind on various parts of the body—the bones fearfully diseased,—the skin covered with a blotchy and noisome eruption—a ghastly and haggard appearance—and the mind a complete and irrecoverable wreck.

    </li>
    <li id=3228 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      On the first appearance of this disorder in the Italian provinces, the horrid lacerations of the human frame, and the attendant excruciating tortures which it inflicted upon its victims, repelled like a plague, the approach of pity, and deterred those whom nature and affection prompted to lend consolation and assistance.

    </li>
    <li id=3229 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Even those afflicted with leprosy counted themselves fortunate in their escape from this more tremendous evil, and shunned the unhappy victims of this disease as they would the bite of a venomous serpent or the shaft of unerring destruction.

    </li>
    <li id=3230 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The poor were compelled to fly from their habitations as soon as any symptoms of the disorder manifested themselves, and take refuge in the abodes of the brute creation, in dens and caverns, and trackless forests.

    </li>
    <li id=3231 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Physicians, friends, relations, and even parents forsook them; the ties of nature were rent asunder, and every social compact was annihilated—so predominant was the fear of infection!

    </li>
    <li id=3232 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In fact, the laws which were made at that time and for many years afterwards against persons laboring under lues venerea were atrociously severe.

    </li>
    <li id=3233 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Persons so afflicted, were sentenced to death if they approached within a certain distance of any principal town or city, and no one would render them the slightest assistance; so that they were left to drag out a miserable existence for the short space of time that still remained to them, deserted alike by friend and foe, until at length nature ceased to struggle against the ravages of disease; and the approach of death, instead of being dreaded, was welcomed, as the kindest and most happy termination that could be anticipated in the fearful misery under which they labored.

    </li>
    <li id=3234 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Many of the ancient authors give most disgusting details of the fearful appearances which the disease assumed in different subjects, but into these evils it is unnecessary now to enter, as the disorder is so well understood by those practitioners who make it their whole study.

    </li>
    <li id=3235 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It will suffice to remark, that in many instances the symptoms closely approximate to those of Elephantiasis; in others,



V





to those of Leprosy; that the disorder frequently corroded the septum and bones of the nose, levelling that important feature with the face, and leaving a most unsightly deformity in its place; that it fed upon the lips: sometimes destroyed the uvula: at others perforated the palate, destroying alike the bones and the soft parts, and completely changed the tones and properties of the voice.

    </li>
    <li id=3236 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The symptoms experienced multitudinous variations, with change of years, many of the old ones becoming greatly modified, and new ones developing themselves, to the great alarm of those who groaned under their influence, as well as to the extreme perplexity of the medical practitioners, who were yet in a state of comparative ignorance with respect to the real nature of the disease; their endeavours to repress its tremendous ravages were consequently directed rather with a view to speculative results, than by any of those positive rules of practice, which the industrious application of subsequent ages has rendered successful.

    </li>
    <li id=3237 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Yet, increased as is our knowledge of the nature of this malady, and improved as is our mode of treatment, it is by no means to be assumed that the disease has become of trifling importance, or that it carries no menace of consequence to the human frame; for with all its modifications, it is still a disorder of that subtle and malignant disposition, that it requires to be watched at its commencement and in its progress with sedulous attention, and to be attacked with all the powers that medicine has in store, as far as can be done without putting in peril the constitution itself.

    </li>
    <li id=3238 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Our attention, for many years past, has been exclusively directed to the treatment of venereal diseases, and of such complaints as arise more immediately from a disordered or diseased condition of the generative system, whether constitutional or acquired.

    </li>
    <li id=3239 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In this statement we must not be understood to cast the slightest imputation upon the skill of other members of our profession, in the treatment of such complaints; on the contrary, we mean simply to infer, that, as in all important undertakings much can be effected by a division of labour, so it is evident that a man who confines his studies to one class of disorders, without diverting any portion of his attention to the more general objects of general practice, must be more intimately acquainted with them, and with more certainty be able to remedy them, than a man whose mind is occupied with the study of all the various and varying diseases to.

    </li>
    <li id=3240 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      which the frame is liable.

    </li>
    <li id=3241 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We need no greater proof of this than the fact, that all great men who have excelled in their profession have made some particular branch of it their more immediate study.

    </li>
    <li id=3242 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Hence some have excelled in medicine, and some in surgery; some in the diseases of men, some more particularly in those of women, and others in those of children.

    </li>
    <li id=3243 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Again, many have applied themselves to the study of certain organs of the human frame; hence we have one man celebrated in the treatment of diseases of the brain, another in those of the eye, ear, stomach, lungs, &amp;c, in short, almost all the different diseases and various organs of the body have, at least in large cities, had their respective professors.

    </li>
    <li id=3244 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Perhaps if this system of the sub-division of medical labour and study had been more generally adopted, disease would not only be more thoroughly understood, but more especially relieved, and less frequent in its occurrence.

    </li>
    <li id=3245 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But, of all disorders, there are none which require more direct, distinct, and uninterrupted study than those concerning the organs of generation; and certainly those members of the profession who direct their attention to these complaints expressly, are the most fit and proper to apply to for cure—so it may reasonably be assumed on our own part, that no less can be the result of an unwearied attention to that particular part of study, wherein we now offer to the public the knowledge and experience of a long and extensive practice.

    </li>
    <li id=3246 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

the contact of infectious matter during sexual intercourse.

    </li>
    <li id=3249 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The symptoms are a discharge of muco-purulent matter from the orifice of the urethra, with a sensation of scalding felt during the act of making water, which is more or less severe according to the virulence of the disease.

    </li>
    <li id=3250 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The muco-purulent discharge which escapes copiously from the canal possesses contagious properties, * that is, it can communicate during sexual congress a similar disease to a person previously uninfected.

    </li>
    <li id=3252 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Its action on healthy mucous membranes is caused by its peculiar stimulating qualities.

    </li>
    <li id=3253 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These are the first and ordinary symptoms; and in some cases the disease stops here; but in others, and indeed, in the greater number of persons attacked, it is found to be much more severe.

    </li>
    <li id=3254 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The discharge increases, the pain and burning sensation in making water become much more intense, the penis is excited to frequent and violent involuntary erections, particularly in the night when warm in bed, during which state it is bent into a curve, constituting that painful but well known condition called Chordee.

    </li>
    <li id=3255 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The absorbent glands in the groin sympathise with the adjacent disturbance, and become slightly inflamed; but, fortunately, rarely suppurate.

      The swellings produced by gonorrhea, are denominated Sympathetic Buboes.

      In the former case, it constitutes a particular affection, designated by medical men, Phymosis, in the latter Paraphymosis.

    <li id=3259 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In cases of mismanagement or carelessness, or in consequence of a sudden suppression of the purulent discharge, an active inflammation of one or both testicles will arise, accompanied with much pain and swelling, called Swelled Testicle.

    </li>
    <li id=3260 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The inflammatory attack in this case runs along the canal of the urethra, to the prostatic portion, where it invades the caput gallinaginis, extending along the common duct and the vas deferens, to the epididymis, which is generally the seat of inflammation before the body of the testicle itself becomes affected.

    </li>
    <li id=3261 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When the inflammation of the canal is severe, it will sometimes happen that, at the time of making water, owing to the rupture of some small blood-vessel in the urethra, a quantity of blood will be voided; but this is rather beneficial than otherwise.

      The disease sometimes extends to the bladder, in which case that organ becomes exceedingly irritable; there is an almost constant desire to make water, and occasionally ulceration is produced, in consequence of which, a quantity of muco-purulent matter is discharged, which mingling with the urine, gives it the appearance of whey.

    </li>
    <li id=3263 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When a gonorrhea is often repeated, (and a person who has once had the disease, is very liable to have additional attacks) or when it has been improperly treated, as by the imprudent use of astringent injections during the inflammatory stage, or by intemperance in living, strictures will ensue—the most distressing, painful, and fatal disease the urethra is subject to, creative at all times of a difficulty of voiding the urine, and not unfrequently inducing a total retention,—in very rare cases suppression may ensue from the incapability of voiding the contents of the bladder.

    </li>
    <li id=3264 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The latter frequently becomes very much distended, and not unfrequently loses in consequence its power of expelling the urine, becoming subject in fact to a species of palsy from the over-distension.

    </li>
    <li id=3265 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In many cases it has been known to give way, causing the pouring out of the urine into the body, and fatal inflammation among the parts which are subject to that irritation.

    </li>
    <li id=3266 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When the inflammatory symptoms attending the gonorrhea have been subdued, and all the bad symptoms are removed, there sometimes remains a discharge from the urethra, of a pale yellow, greenish, or whitish colour, unaccompanied by pain, or scalding, or chordee, and lasting for an indefinite time—for months, sometimes for years.

    </li>
    <li id=3267 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This discharge is called Gleet.

      They spring up round the gland and prepuce in great numbers.

    </li>
    <li id=3271 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In some habits, they are always increased by, and often owe their origin, to want of cleanliness; they are accordingly found in all localities where that point is most neglected.

    </li>
    <li id=3272 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Another unpleasant consequence of gonorrhea, is Excoriation, which is an eruption of small vesicles around the corona of the gland, and between it and the foreskin, on the fold or reduplication of skin connecting them together.

    </li>
    <li id=3273 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They break, leaving the membrane red and excoriated—hence the name of the disease.

      They may arise from any other irritation as well as that of gonorrhea.

    </li>
    <li id=3275 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In this state the membrane of the gland and foreskin will pour out a purulent or muco-purulent discharge; and in some instances, where the foreskin is tightly contracted before the gland, it assumes the appearance of a clap, and is attended in such cases with very severe symptoms.

    </li>
    <li id=3276 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To the foregoing painful catalogue of symptoms might be added many others; for this dreadful malady frequently puts on the appearance of other disorders, and many unfortunate persons may labour for years under afflictions, originating from a venereal cause, mistaking them for gouty or bilious affections, rheumatic pains, palsies, convulsions, asthma, king&#39;s evil, leprosy, &amp;c.

      , all of which may arise from, or be connected with a venereal taint; for there is scarcely any distemper that has put on so many different shapes, or been attended with such a variety of symptoms; and if proper remedies be not timely obtained, the vital as well as the natural animal functions are depraved, the body becomes emaciated and unfit for action, and the unfortunate victim awaits with impatience the kind messenger, Death, to put a period to his miserable existence.

      This disease has been described as one of the most surprising phenomena in the history of medicine, whether as regards the malignant inveteracy of its symptoms, or the singular mode in which it is produced and propagated.

      As these disorders are sometimes violent, and attended with a variety of symptoms—such as buboes, ulcers, inflammations, &amp;c, it will be necessary for the patient to be made acquainted with the nature of his complaint, which may sometimes require outward applications that may be had for a trifle from any druggist.

    </li>
    <li id=3288 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

      GONORRHEA, OR CLAP.

    </li>
    <li id=3290 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A virulent clap is an involuntary and constant discharge of corrupted mucus from the glands at the commencement of the urethra in men, or from the upper part of the vagina in women, and is caused by connexion with an infected person.

    </li>
    <li id=3291 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The quantity of the discharge is in proportion to the degree of inflammation which is present, and its quality to the malignity of the infectious matter received in impure copulation.

    </li>
    <li id=3292 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The first symptom of this disorder is generally uneasiness about the parts of generation, with titillation at the end of the penis; to this succeed the appearance of a little whitish matter at the orifice of the urethra, slight swelling, and sometimes a redness on the gland, 01 the head of the penis, and a trifling pungency on the evac





nation of the urine.

    </li>
    <li id=3293 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The discharge soon increases; the inflammation at the orifice of the urethra becomes more palpable, and extends further down the canal; the parts begin to burn, and the evacuation of the urine is attended with a scalding heat which greatly torments the parts affected; besides which there is also a swelling of the lacunce or the mouths of the internal glands of the urethra, with a manifest and painful rigidity on the erection of the penis.

    </li>
    <li id=3294 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They sometimes become indurated, and the seat of ulcers, and may be felt externally along the passage.

    </li>
    <li id=3295 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The discharge still becomes more copious, grows thinner, loses its adhesiveness, and becomes of a yellowish, or rather a greenish complexion: the mouth of the penis begins to exhibit an increasing redness, the passing of the urine is accompanied by excruciating pain from the irritation of the urethra, and such general symptoms of inflammation, as to prevent the extension of the penis in erection, curving it downwards with agonizing torture, which is rendered still more intolerable if the member be raised towards the belly.

    </li>
    <li id=3296 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The torture of this situation is greatly exaggerated by the influence of that inseparable stimulus which causes frequent erections of the diseased member, especially when warm in bed, attended with a degree of anguish which prevents sleep, or awakens the patient, if he have been fortunate enough to obtain a short relief from his sufferings by sleep, and not uncommonly produces involuntary emissions of the semen.

    </li>
    <li id=3297 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This is the usual type of the virulent gonorrhea, but all the diseases of this unhappy class are of a complicated and varied nature: they embrace in their consequences so many painful diseases, that we never consider them, however slight in appearance, as mere local effects, but always dread their approach to a constitutional character; for by a deplorable tendency, to which limit is unknown, the most trivial cases of these diseases, in their prolific energy, become the fruitful mine of a thousand discordant feelings and symptoms, that harass their devoted victim for an indefinite period: therefore we strongly recommend in all casea a i) immediate recourse to our applications, in order that the remedies may be effectively employed at their onset.

    </li>
    <li id=3298 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In diseases of this kind, large evacuations of any kind are to be carefully guarded against; for in all the cases we have seen in which they have been used, they have done injury, by producing either irritability of the stomach or of the bowels, and thus rendering the system unequal to the retention of the necessary remedies.

    </li>
    <li id=3299 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The period at which the disease makes its appearance is generally from four to eight days after connexion: though in this there is no certain rule; for the symptoms will, with some individuals, discover themselves as early as twenty-four hours, and in other cases, although very rarely, not for some weeks.

    </li>
    <li id=3300 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The discharge in gonorrhea proceeds from the membrane lining the urethra, and from the lacunae, which are met with so numerously in the canal.

    </li>
    <li id=3301 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In some we find it in small quantities, attended only by slight pain, while in others, the discharge is copious and the pain and chordee most severe.

    </li>
    <li id=3302 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These various circumstances do not seem of themselves in any remarkable manner to influence the duration of the clap.

    </li>
    <li id=3303 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In some a slight discharge will be easily removed in two or three days, while in others it will, independently of the use of our medicines, remain for several weeks.

    </li>
    <li id=3304 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In cases too, where the discharge happens to be very free, we find the same uncertainty attends its removal, therefore no time should be lost in applying for relief.

    </li>
    <li id=3305 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When the inflammation is very severe, the glands immediately beneath the membrane of the urethra are sometimes rendered completely incapable of secreting, so that the discharge is then apparently checked.

    </li>
    <li id=3306 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In severe inflammation affecting the mucous membrane of the nose or of the trachea, we find the same phenomena occur, and the first sign of this violent degree of action beginning to abate, is the return of the suppressed discharges.

    </li>
    <li id=3307 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It has been asserted that the longer the pain and discharge of clap continue, the farther the disease advances along the urethra, till it reaches the prostatic part of the canal, the caput gallinaginis, and even to the bladder itself, the mucous membrane of which may partake in the inflammatory action.

    </li>
    <li id=3308 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To ascertain the progress the disease makes along the urethra, we may apply pressure along various parts thereof on the under surface of the penis, and observe whether, under such circumstances, the discharge flows in increased quantity from its orifice.

    </li>
    <li id=3309 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Suppuration and ulcer occur from neglect in the earlier stage of the disorder; or from an improper mode of treatment, engendering various other genital disorders, of which mention will be hereafter made.

    </li>
    <li id=3310 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In fact, some medical practitioners of eminence have laid it down that neglect and maltreatment will mature gonorrhea into general syphilis; and that when the original symptoms are suffered to continue, or the infection is extremely virulent, chancres will form upon the gland or upon the foreskin of the penis; the mucus increases, and is discharged in larger quantities, tinging the linen with a yellow or greenish stain.

    </li>
    <li id=3311 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The duration of gonorrhea depends much on the constitution and regimen of the patient, but far more on the treatment to which it is submitted.

    </li>
    <li id=3312 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Numerous examples have fallen under our notice of patients, who after labouring for three or four months under this malady, have in less than a fortnight after taking the Purifying Specific Pills, and Cordial Balm Of Syriacum, received the most effectual relief.

    </li>
    <li id=3313 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This period is, in fact, amply sufficient for the cure of ten cases out of every twelve; and when the constitutionhas never been degraded by acquired or hereditary injuries, health and vigour are not unusually the immediate effects of a few days&#39; care and attention.

    </li>
    <li id=3314 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The first stage of this disease in women, has been frequently mistaken by experienced persons for fluor albus, and has been treated as such; but the matter discharged in that complaint is larger in quantity, generally less yellow, and of a less consistent nature, than that which accompanies a virulent gonorrhea.

    </li>
    <li id=3315 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Independently of this distinction, however, a venereal infection is attended with a peculiar heat, inflammation and pain, which are not the general concomitants of a white flux.

    </li>
    <li id=3316 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is to be admitted, however, that a vitiated case of fluor albus may bring on, by sexual intercourse^ a disease in men hardly to be equalled in severity, by the most obdurate gonorrhea.

    </li>
    <li id=3317 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In cases of gonorrhea or clap in both sexes, the patient must take two of Perry&#39;s Purifying Specific Pills at night and two in the morning, and one tea spoonful of the following mixture three times a day; it can be made up by any druggist:—





When the patient is particularly desirous for a speedy recovery, the addition of the Cordial Balm Of SyriAcum, in the proportion of one tablespoonful mixed with each dose of the above mixture will wonderfully facilitate and expedite the cure.

    </li>
    <li id=3318 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The bowels should be regularly acted on, but not violently.

    </li>
    <li id=3319 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Immersing the penis in warm water will not only abate the symptoms, but also tend to keep it clean, an object of importance, and by which much future inconvenience may be avoided.

    </li>
    <li id=3320 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Passing water also with the penis immersed in a basin of warm water, with a small quantity of laudanum in it, or some decoction of poppy heads will tend to relieve the distressing pricking and scalding experienced in the urethra, when micturation is practised.

    </li>
    <li id=3321 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Excessive purging would be very hurtful, would produce debility, and keep up the discharge, by the local irritation it would produce, and thus by the effort of relaxation favouring absorption, accelerate the introduction of the contagion into the general system.

    </li>
    <li id=3322 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Should symptoms of inflammation appear, the Mixture ordered and the Cordial Balm Of Syriacum must be entirely discontinued until the inflammatory state is abated; and the bowels must be kept open by the following Senna mixture :—

      Where the patient is late in applying for assistance, and symptoms of strangury, or difficulty in making water have appeared, the secretion passing only in drops, with much pain, the inflammation must be subdued by the senna mixture, before any other plan is attempted; which then must be taken in doses of three table-spoonsful every morning.

      During the progress of gonorrhea, attention to cleanliness cannot be too much recommended, by frequently washing the parts with warm milk-and-water, to prevent the acrimony of the discharge, which is apt to irritate the skin where it touches; to prevent this, it may also be proper to cover the point of the penis with a small bit of lint, to imbibe the discharge.

SWELLED TESTICLE

Is generally occasioned by great exercise, as jumping,

    <li id=3377 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The pain is then most intense, even when the testicle is at perfect rest, probably owing to the non-distensibility of the tunica albuginea, with which the testicle is invested.

    </li>
    <li id=3382 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This symptom is a very frequent attendant on gonorrhea, particularly when severe bodily exercise, irregularity of living, or excess, have been indulged in, too strong, and irritating injections used, or the too liberal application of the bougie has been had recourse to.

    </li>
    <li id=3383 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

      It is not so common for both testicles to swell at once, as for one to be first affected, and when it begins to recover, the other to be affected, and, in this way, unless under proper management, the disease is often protracted for several weeks.

    </li>
    <li id=3387 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      On its first approach, the patient feels as if the testicle affected was, from time to time, in a state of slight motion, but this soon gives place to dull, heavy, burdensome pain, to which is soon added twitching darting sensations.

    </li>
    <li id=3388 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It gradually, sometimes quickly, increases in size, and a throbbing sensation is felt in it, so that its suspension by a bandage becomes necessary.

      This symptom, unless from improper treatment, seldom remains; but when the discharge entirely ceases, before the swelling has subsided, it often continues in the some condition for years, and sometimes for life.

      The testicles should be supported or bound up with a linen truss or bandage; if the patient is of full habit of body, bleeding will be proper; the diet in this case should be as low as possible.

      The following fomentation will be requisite :—

Take of extract of lead a tablespoonful, vinegar four tablespoonsful, water a quart: shake them together and foment (as warm as the patient can bear with ease) the swelled parts with flannel frequently for some time together: after each time of fomenting, apply a warm poultice of bread and milk under the whole private parts, and take the Pills regularly.

    <li id=3396 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Should the swelling not go down, it will be then proper to apply eight or ten leeches to the testicles, and repeat them for two or three days; the Jomentatwns being freely applied after the leeches have fallen off.

    </li>
    <li id=3397 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If the patient in a previous gonorrhea has been troubled with this symptom, he should not neglect to keep the testicles supported while the clap continues, as the swelling is apt to return.

      It is, however, more commonly a disease dependant on an ill-cured gonorrhoea, or is a sequence of that disorder, having lost its irritable malignity, becoming simple in its appearance, but of alarming consequence in its duration, because it may and does often induce seminal weakness and several other complaints; it is especially dangerous as being auxiliary to the formation of stricture of the urethra, a distressing complaint.

      Gleet will remain a chronic, or continual disease, for weeks, months, nay even years; and under the changes incident to habit and regimen, the symptoms will vary in severity, a circumstance which has not unfrequently led medical men into the error of supposing such changes to arise from fresh infection: in these cases the patient has over and over again submitted to the routine of pharmaceutical doubt, and not until his

      The discharge in gleet, however, is very much regulated by the habit and diet of the patient; if he is accustomed to indulge freely in the luxuries of the table and bottle, or in violent exercise, it will be increased both in quantity and acrimony; while on the other hand temperance and regularity of diet and exercise will materially assist the effects of our medicines, by gradually diminishing the discharge and ultimately relieving the patient of his long continued torment.

      The eyelids are tumefied, so as to render it difficult to separate them, and every part of the membrane pours out a highly contagious discharge, a single drop of which is sufficient to produce the disease in another person, if applied to the eye.

      Stricture is a disease that obstructs the free passage of the urine, and causes it either to come in a small forked or twisted stream, or drop by drop, with considerable pain: if the urethral canal be not much diminished in calibre by the stricture, it may exist many years without producing any great degree of inconvenience; but though this may be the case respecting the evacuation of the urine, we are led to conceive that





the semen, in consequence, in the action of coition may not properly be directed into the vagina; for not issuing at the moment of ejaculation from the urethra, it afterwards falls merely by the effects of its specific gravity: of course attention to this stage of the disease becomes requisite; and more particularly in the advanced period of life, as the power by which the urine is evacuated, and the semen ejected necessarily becomes weaker.

      Although stricture may arise from constitutional causes, from malformation or spasm, or from other accidental circumstances, the cure of which must depend upon minute reference to the particular cause, yet the source of this distressing complaint, in nineteen cases out of twenty, is to be traced to venereal disease, or to an improper method of treating gonorrhea.

    </li>
    <li id=3445 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We may look upon the inflammation of gonorrhea, (after it has continued a long time,) as producing a new action in the vessels of the urethra at a particular point, by which a sort of membranous band is formed round the internal urethra, the circle of which being hard, and situated within the natural space is denominated a stricture.

    </li>
    <li id=3446 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It may be considered that the urethra being hollow, muscular, and membranous, and naturally predisposed to contraction, is readily affected by inflammation or violence of any kind; but the progress of stricture is variable in different habits.

    </li>
    <li id=3447 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Tropical climate, sedentary pursuits, excessive indulgence in—or unnaturally protracted—sexual intercourse, are sometimes the causes of stricture; and in irritable habits will excite the disease, without the intervention of any venereal complaint.

    </li>
    <li id=3448 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Spasmodic stricture is generally seated at the neck of the bladder or on the membranous part of the urethra.

    </li>
    <li id=3449 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It may occur to persons in good health from exposure to wet and cold, from derangement of the organs of digestion, from long retention of urine, particularly when walking (owing to the absence of public urinals,) or to violent horse exercise: but more frequently does it happen to those young men, who, when suffering from gleet or gonorrhea imperfectly or only partially cured, are tempted to commit an excess in Tine, spirits, and other strong drinks.

    </li>
    <li id=3450 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Surrounded by jovial society, glassful after glassful is swallowed, each one to be the last.

    </li>
    <li id=3451 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The patient, with his bladder full to repletion, scarcely able to retain his water, yet, probably &quot;going&quot; every moment, represses his desire until the party breaks up, when, on encountering the cold air he finds himself unable to void even a drop, or if so only with extreme difficulty.

    </li>
    <li id=3452 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The greater the effort and the more determined the straining, the greater is the impossibility; and unless relief be speedily afforded, the most alarming consequences may ensue.

    </li>
    <li id=3453 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Notwithstanding the danger attendant upon a neglected or severe case of spasmodic stricture, when judiciously treated none need be apprehended.

    </li>
    <li id=3454 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The patient should instantly send for a surgeon to draw off the urine—there will seldom be any difficulty in passing the catheter, especially if the operator be not too hasty, and be at all dexterous in the use of his instrument.

    </li>
    <li id=3455 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Force should never be employed: but as this devolves on the surgeon, the patient need be under no apprehension; a constant use of the CorDial Balm Of Syriacum And Purifying Specific Pills, for a few weeks subsequently, will remove this unpleasant disorder.

    </li>
    <li id=3456 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The formation of a permanent stricture has been attributed to various causes; most of these have been already enumerated; there is one however not yet mentioned, which is popularly but erroneously considered to be a most efficient cause*—namely, the use of astringent injections in the treatment of gonorrhea and gleet.

    </li>
    <li id=3457 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The origin of this opinion may be readily traced to the fact that permanent stricture invariably depends on the results of inflammation in the deposition of lymph in the cellular tissue surrounding that part of the urethra where the contraction is found, and as gonorrhea is in itself a peculiar form of inflammation, from which persons labouring under stricture have generally previously suffered, and as generally the disease has been neglected, injections being had recourse to ultimately to remove a long standing effect, persons have been apt to attribute to the remedy, that which is in reality only due to the disease for which the remedy was used.

    </li>
    <li id=3458 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Permanent stricture is characterised by a difficulty which is constantly experienced in the discharge of the urine, which comes away at first in a stream diminished in size, then forked or twisted, something like a corkscrew in shape, and afterwards, as the disease becomes more severe and the stricture more contracted, it is discharged only by a few drops at a time, and that too with excessive pain and difficulty.

    </li>
    <li id=3459 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Occasionally the presence of a stricture is attended with a constant dribbling away of the urine, which apparently nothing can prevent.

    </li>
    <li id=3460 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The canal of the urethra is the seat of considerable irritation, and a gleety discharge is generally met with.

    </li>
    <li id=3461 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There may be one, two, or more strictures in the course of the canal, and sometimes the third lobe of the prostate becomes enlarged, the disease having extended nearly to the bladder.

    </li>
    <li id=3462 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If the stricture be allowed to continue unchecked, the canal of the urethra will enlarge behind it; forming a sinus in which the urine collects, and exciting inflammation and ulceration; the urethra itself finally bursts, allowing the urine to escape into the pelvis and the cellular tissue of the perineum, where it causes great inflammation, abscesses, and even gangrene.

    </li>
    <li id=3463 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      All this while the disease is attended with considerable fever, and the patient&#39;s life is placed in great jeopardy.

    </li>
    <li id=3464 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Nor does the bladder escape; subacute inflammation of its mucous membrane is set up—a mucous glairy secretion is poured forth in great quantity, the urine becomes ammoniacal, and offensive, and the kidneys soon partake in the disorder, becoming the seat of inflammation, with dilatation of their tubes and pelves, and ultimately suppuration sets in, which in a period more or less prolonged, according to the intensity of the disease, and the state of constitution of the patient, terminates the existence of the unfortunate sufferer.

    </li>
    <li id=3465 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the treatment of this severe disease, constitutional remedies must be employed, and surgical applications also had recourse to.

    </li>
    <li id=3466 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The use of the bougie is indispensably necessary—in addition to which balsam&#39; medicines must be given internally, conjoined with the same plan of proceeding recommended in cases of spasmodic stricture.

The precursor of chancre is a slight inflammation, followed by a little pimple; this gradually exposes a small pustule, the fluid in which is first transparent, then white; it breaks, and a small but spreading ulcer is formed, sometimes painful—generally sore; it has hard protuberent ash-colour edges, covered with a white slough, and is difficult of cure.

    </li>
    <li id=3530 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

      When the chancre is situated under the prepuce, or foreskin, and the latter covering is so inflamed and swollen as to prevent its being drawn back to exhibit the sore, the discharge should be carefully washed out by any of the lotions already recommended, by means of a syringe, several times in the twenty-four hours.

action to the palms of the hand: the breath becomes offensive; and the teeth also suffer.

      The symptoms which mark the disease are as follows :—The patient experiences in the evening a sensation of dull aching, wearing pain in the bones, which is afterwards the seat of the node.

    <li id=3616 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the course of a few days a swelling appears in the evening, which disappears again on the following morning; it is excessively painful and tender at night, but in the morning it is hardly perceptible, and the tenderness is almost gone.

      Of all the disorders of the human frame, there is none which has baffled the skill of medical men more than Syphilis; and when we look to the general treatment of this disease in all its various forms, we cannot but deplore the great loss of life, which is daily occuring from the use of that deadly poison, Mercury, whieh is constantly administered by medical men, in cases of the venereal disease; the blood in the system is poisoned, and by being so, it conveys, wherever it travels in the arteries and veins, the seeds of disease.

      The blood thus poisoned goes to the heart, and diseases of this organ are the consequence: it goes to the lungs, and these organs become morbidly deranged: in fact, to whatever organ it travels, there it lays the foundation of disease.

      In cases like these, it has hitherto been the custom of the faculty, not to rid the system of the poison which is destroying the unhappy suffer by inches, and preying upon his vitals, but they have pursued a course of treatment as incorrect with sound theory, as it is repugnant to humanity and common sense.

      The details contained in the preceding chapter respecting the causes, nature, symptoms, and progress of the various forms of the venereal disease, will sufficiently explain why these maladies are held in such dread and horror by most persons, that rather than incur the risk of contagion from impure copulation, they prefer the certainty of the evils, both bodily and mental, which inevitably follow sooner or later the practice of selfpollution.

    </li>
    <li id=3669 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There cannot exist a doubt in the minds of all right thinking men, that youths, from the dread of contagion and the family quarrels that might arise therefrom, as well as being led away by bad advice and evil example, are prone to exercise the functions of nature, and to gratify the passions which the period of puberty awakens into life, by yielding to the insidious advice of the tempter, and practising a crime which, as we have already fully shewn, is condemned alike by God and man, and which will assuredly bring in its train, a long series of diseases and wretchedness both of mind and body, and ultimately induce premature old age, decay, and an early and miserable termination to existence.

    </li>
    <li id=3670 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Young men who have attained the adult period of life, may in many instances avoid the (supposed) necessity for the commission of this sin, by entering into the marriage state.

      Pecuniary circumstances may interfere; a young man may be fully capable of supporting himself in comfort, or he may be ready to rough it for himself, while he would naturally feel very unwilling to plunge another, and that an affectionate and beloved wife, into the endurance of the discomforts which to him are nothing, but to a female tenderly and carefully brought up, would be a source of constant annoyance, despite the care and affection she would experience from her husband.

    </li>
    <li id=3673 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Many young men, again, hold back from matrimony, from the fear of having a large family at a too early an age; others again are prevented by family reasons: in short it would be almost an endless task to enumerate all the reasons which keep the young men of the present day, in the forlorn condition of bachelors.

      Buffon held this position, &quot;the natural state of man after puberty is marriage;&quot; but this is evidently untenable, because the human body is not fully developed at this period of life, the different functions are not perfect, and as the organs are only in the progress of their growth, the offspring would be infirm and delicate; and the sexes totally incompetent to perform their various important duties of parents.

      It is at, or rather after the adult age, that the mind and body have arrived at perfection; and therefore moralists and legislators have fixed this age as the best for marriage.

      Hence it follows, that the premature exertion of the genital functions, or marriage at too early an age, must not only be highly injurious to the parents in most cases, but also to the constitution of the offspring.

      It is also a moral and medical precept, that both male and female should observe the strictest continence until the adult age, so that the great end of marriage, the propagation of healthy children may be accomplished.

      It is also well known that parents contaminated with ill-cured syphilis, often beget infants which are born dead and decomposed between the seventh and eighth month of pregnancy; and that the disease in question is a common cause of premature parturition.

      Dear Sirs,—A few months ago I called at your establishment for your advice, when you recommended a course of the Balm of Syriacum.

    </li>
    <li id=3863 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I am at last, with much shame, induced to address you on the miserable situation I was in, when I commenced taking your blessed Medicine.

    </li>
    <li id=3864 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I am convinced the disease I was afflicted with, was solely occasioned by my having contracted, in my early youth, a most infamous habit, the continual practice of which had totally destroyed my constitution.

    </li>
    <li id=3865 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The health of my body was not only affected, but the powers of my mind were much weakened; my judgment had lost its solidity, and my memory its retentive faculties: my head was confused, and subject to frequent swimmings, and I was much troubled with an oppression at my chest which occasioned a constant perspiration.

    </li>
    <li id=3866 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I had pains in my stomach and weakness and a general debility with constant yawning, and drowsiness; my appetite was fluctuating, my spirits greatly depressed, so that at times I could scarcely refrain from sighing and involuntary weeping; my eyes were inflamed and frequently emitted a watery humour; in a word I was an object of misery.

    </li>
    <li id=3867 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I paid strict attention to your advice, and continued taking the Medicine according to your directions for about three months.

    </li>
    <li id=3868 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I am now perfectly recovered; therefore I think it not only my duty to acknowledge the service you have done me, but to inform the Public for the benefit of others, who labour under the same, Qx any disease similar to those from which I am so happily recovered.

      A seminal discharge always preceded a perfect erection, which at first I was weak enough to attribute to a strong desire of possession, but the same disappointment continuing, I had recourse to drinking, which instead of remedying the evil, only increased it; no kind of erection could I procure, and I positively emitted the seed always before connection took place.

    </li>
    <li id=3879 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The distress caused by my being in this unfortunate predicament was greatly heightened by the fear that my wife had dropped some hints to her mother of my incapacity for matrimonial duty, and I looked on a divorce as inevitable, when I was advised by a friend, whom I acquainted with my truly critical situation, to purchase some bottles of your Cordial Balm of Syriacum.

      Perseverance in taking this excellent medicine has given stamina to my constitution, of which 1 thought my youthful excesses had entirely bereft it; in about five months it accomplished a cure, and it is with pleasure, I now inform you, that my wife is pregnant with her first child, of which I think 1 should never have been the father, had it not been for your precious medicine.

      I was sent to school not far from London, where I was very early initiated in the baneful practice of Self-pollution, which with shame I confess I have followed with very little interruption till a short time since, when I, fortunately for myself, saw your invaluable little Treatise.

      I am not, thank God, now so much troubled with nocturnal emissions, but the semen which I used to void in my wretched practice; was always thin and watery, and I found at last after one acta, I had great difficulty in obtaining another.

Many persons who have imagined themselves cured of the venereal disease, have had the misfortune to find the disease break out again six or seven years afterwards.

    </li>
    <li id=3964 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A proof of this happened in our practice the other day.

    </li>
    <li id=3965 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A gentleman was afflicted with the complaint, and was cured as he thought by the advice and prescription of an eminent surgeon.

    </li>
    <li id=3966 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He afterwards entered on the state of matrimony, four months after which, he caught a violent cold, which terminated in a sore throat.

    </li>
    <li id=3967 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      At this crisis we were applied to, and informed him that it proceeded from an old venereal complaint.

    </li>
    <li id=3968 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He then called in an apothecary, who treated his complaint as a common sore throat, until he became so bad, that he was compelled to call in a medical man, who confirmed the truth of what we had told him, but too late for his recovery, so that he fell a sacrifice to his obstinacy.

    </li>
    <li id=3969 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Persons, therefore, should be extremely cautious in causing the eradication of this complaint, for which nothing is better than Messes.

      Whatever stage of the complaint the patients may be in, or whatever the mode of curing may consist of, the Cordial Balm Of Syriacum is evidently one of the most efficacious and valuable additions to venereal remedies that can possibly be adopted.

      It contains the most valuable properties as a medicine in these diseases we could wish for; an alterative, antivenereal, and stimulating diaphoretic, it conveys its active principles throughout the body, penetrating even the minutest vessels, removing all corruptions, contaminations and impurities from the vital stream, searching out the morbid virus, and radically expelling it through the skin.
